The documentation below provides information about the types of API calls available with ONTAP 9.8, as well as details about using each API endpoint. You can learn more about the ONTAP REST API in the ONTAP automation doc site: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/ </br>\n## Using the ONTAP 9.8 REST API online documentation\nEach API method includes usage examples, as well as a model that displays all the required and optional properties supported by the method. Click the _Model_ link, available with each API method, to see all the required and optional properties supported by each method.\n## Features for all ONTAP APIs\n<details id=\"Getting_started_with_the_ONTAP_REST_API\">\n  <summary>Getting started with the ONTAP REST API</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  Let's review some key things about RESTful APIs and how they're implemented in ONTAP:\n  * REST API URLs identify the resources that you'll be working with, including clusters, SVMs, and storage.\n  * REST APIs use HTTP methods GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and OPTIONS to indicate their actions.\n  * REST APIs return common HTTP status codes to indicate the results of each call. Additional error details can be included in the results body.\n  * REST APIs request and response bodies are encoded using JSON.\n  * REST APIs support hyperlinking among resources using the Content-Type \"application/hal+json\".\n  * GET calls on collections usually return only name and UUID by default. If you want to retrieve additional properties, you need to specify them using the “fields” query parameter.\n  * ONTAP supports query-based DELETE or PATCH for all collection endpoints.\n  If you're already familiar with the ONTAPI API (also known as ZAPI), there are some similarities between ONTAP REST APIs and ONTAPI. For example:\n  * Both support the same transport and security mechanisms.\n  * Both paginate results based on either number of seconds or number of records.\n  * Both support filtering the returned records based on property values.\n  * Both support limiting the returned properties.\n  * Both support concurrent requests. If ONTAP temporarily can't handle additional calls, it will respond with an HTTP error status code of 503.\n  However, there are important differences between REST APIs and the ONTAP CLI and ONTAPI that you should understand as well:\n  * In many cases, ONTAP REST APIs use different names for fields and features.\n  * REST APIs do not expose infrequently used CLI parameters.\n  * REST APIs do not treat the cluster or nodes as an SVM (aka Vserver).\n  * REST GET APIs support specifying a maximum time before paginating results. However, the default time is 15 seconds for REST (instead of 90 seconds for ONTAPI).\n  * REST APIs are generally ordered by UUID or ID, so a rename operation using the PATCH method doesn't change the path keys.\n  * REST APIs use one or more of the following properties to identify a resource: \"name\", \"uuid\", \"id\".\n  * REST APIs often execute the equivalent of multiple CLI commands in a single request.\n  * REST API properties use underscores instead of hyphens between words.\n  * REST API dates are always in ISO-8601 format.\n  * REST API comparisons between enum values (for <, >, ranges, and `order_by`) are done alphabetically. (In CLI and ONTAPI, enum comparisions are done based on an internal value for the enum.)\n  * REST API field '<' queries exclude records where the specified field is not set. You can add \"|null\" (eg: limit=<10|null) to also return records where the specified field is not set.\n</details>\n<details id=\"HAL_linking\">\n  <summary>HAL linking</summary>\n  ### Hypertext Application Language (HAL)\n  ONTAP REST APIs use HAL as the mechanism to support Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS). When an object or attribute is returned that identifies a specific resource, a HAL-encoded link is also returned so that you can easily discover resources and be able to obtain more details about the resource.\n  #### Example\n  ```\n  \"aggregate\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c\",\n      \"name\": \"aggr0\",\n      \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n              \"href\": \"/api/storage/aggregates/19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c\"\n          }\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Query_parameters\">\n  <summary>Query parameters</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  The following is a list of all the globally supported query parameters. This list is intended as a quick reference for syntax purposes. The query parameters are described in more detail in other sections of this documentation. Note that multiple queries can be combined using an \"&\".\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  # Request specific fields\n  fields=<field>[,...]\n  # Query fields by value. If the value contains query characters (*|,!<>..), it must be quoted to avoid their special query meaning\n  <field>=<query value>\n  # Return the records array\n  return_records=<true|false>\n  # Timeout and return after the specified number of seconds\n  return_timeout=<0..120 seconds>\n  # The number of records to collect (or act on for query-based PATCH/DELETE) before returning\n  max_records=<number of records>\n  # Request a customized sort ordering\n  order_by=<field [asc|desc]>[,...]\n  $orderBy=<field [asc|desc]>[,...]\n  # Pretty print JSON response bodies\n  pretty=<true|false>\n  # Continue after encountering a failure. Only applicable to query-based PATCH and DELETE.\n  continue_on_failure=<true|false>\n  # Begin returning records starting at an offset from the first record\n  offset=<offset from first record>\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Query_based_PATCH_and_DELETE\">\n  <summary>Query-based PATCH and DELETE</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  Although they are not documented as individual methods in the list of REST APIs, every API supporting PATCH or DELETE on a resource instance also supports PATCH or DELETE on the collection as long as at least one field is specified in the query portion of the URL. A PATCH or DELETE method issued on a collection is equivalent to internally doing a query-based GET, followed by a serial PATCH or DELETE operation on each matching record. However, it only does the operation for `return_timeout` seconds, which is 15 seconds by default. If a query-based operation is not completed before `return_timeout` seconds, the API returns a next link. The client must use the next link with the same HTTP method to continue the operation. Query-based operations will not continue to the next record until the operation on the prior record is completed, even for operations that are normally asynchronous.\n  #### Example\n  ```\n  # Modify the state of all volumes named \"simpson\" to be offline\n  PATCH /api/storage/volumes?name=simpson\n  { \"state\": \"offline\" }\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Record_filtering\">\n  <summary>Record filtering</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  Records may either be filtered by performing queries that only apply to a single field at a time (though multiple of such queries may be done simultaneously for different fields), or by applying queries that search across a set of fields for a value fulfilling a single specified query.\n  ### Filtering records with single field queries\n  You can filter the results of a GET call using any attribute. The supplied query can either be for an exact value or can leverage special query operators.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  <field>=<query value>\n  ```\n  <br/>Filtering allows you to select objects where the specified field matches the supplied query, or which can contain wildcards, ranges, negations, or an OR-defined list of the above. The special query operators include the following:\n  #### Wildcard: `*`\n  ```\n  abc*\n  abc*xyz\n  *xyz\n  ```\n  #### Comparison: `<   >   <=   >=`\n  ```\n  <10\n  >=joe\n  ```\n  #### Range: `..`\n  ```\n  3..10\n  jim..joe\n  ```\n  #### Negation: `!`\n  ```\n  !3\n  !joe\n  !abc*\n  !jim..joe\n  ```\n  #### Any of a list: `|`\n  ```\n  3|5\n  3|5..9|>100\n  ```\n  #### Escaping: `{} and \"\"`\n  The special query characters above can be treated literally, with no special meaning, by enclosing the value in either double quotes or curly braces.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  \"joe*\"\n  {a|b}\n  ```\n  ### Filtering records with cross-field queries\n  Cross-field queries are useful when multiple fields should be searched for a value or some combination of values. Whereas traditional queries only allow a single field to be searched for a value, cross-field queries will return rows where any field in a specified set of fields matches the query. Cross-field queries may only be used for GET requests.\n  <br>\n  The fields to be queried across are specified in the \"query_fields=\" parameter. This should be a comma-delimited list of fields, or simply '\\*' to search across all fields.\n  To specify the query to use in the search, pass in the \"query=\" parameter to a GET request with the string to use as the query. Fields may also be excluded from searching prefixing with '!'. This is useful if all fields are specified with '*', and then certain fields wish to be excluded, or if an an entire object was queried, to exclude certain sub-fields.\n  ### Structure of the query\n  The query string represents a pattern to search for in all fields specified.\n  <br>\n  The '\\*' character is used to indicate wildcard character matching. '\\*'  matches 0 or more of any character. For a query of \"foo*bar\", matches will include \"foo123abcbar\", \"foobar\", and \"foo___123abcbar\".\n  To search for any match among several possible patterns, the values may be ORed together with the '|' character. For example, to seach for \"foo\" OR \"bar\", pass in \"query=foo|bar\". This may be extended to an arbitrary number of values, such as \"query=foo|bar|baz\".\n  <br>\n  Similarly, the query can be used to specify that multiple patterns must be found across all fields specified in \"query_fields\" for a row to be returned. To specify that multiple patterns must be found, include a space between each one. For example, to search across fields where the fields must contain both \"foo\" AND \"bar\", provide \"query=foo bar\". Again, this may be used on an arbitrary number of patterns. To search for rows that contain all of \"foo\" AND \"bar\" AND \"baz\" within the fields specified, provide \"query=foo bar baz\".\n  <br>\n  It should be noted that it is possible for all of the matches to a query to appear in a single field. For example, if \"query=foo bar\", and a field queried contains \"foo bar blah\", it will be considered a match. Obviously the queries matches can also be spread across different fields.\n  ### Examples\n  The following data is used for the examples below:\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 1 | widget1 | blue | chocolate | 1 2 3 | black cherry |\n  | 2 | widget2 | red | spinach | three fifty | maple |\n  | 3 | widget3 | rainbow | strawberry |  thirty | spruce |\n  | 4 | widget4 | brown | strawberry chocolate | thirteen | willow |\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=color', 'query=red'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 2 | widget3 | red | spinach | three fifty | maple |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> The only row with a \"color\" column matching \"red\" is row 2.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=id,number', 'query=3'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 1 | widget1 | blue | chocolate | 1 2 3 | black cherry |\n  | 3 | widget3 | rainbow | strawberry | fourty two | spruce |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> Column \"id\" for row 3 matches the query, and column \"number\" for number for row 1 matches as well.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=flavor', 'query=chocolate|strawberry'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 1 | widget1 | blue | chocolate | 1 2 3 | black cherry |\n  | 3 | widget3 | rainbow | strawberry | fourty two | spruce |\n  | 4 | widget4 | brown | strawberry chocolate | thirteen | willow |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> This query returns rows containing chocolate and/or strawberry in the flavor column. Rows 1, 2, and 4 all contain matches. Row 4 actually matches both queries.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=flavor', 'query=chocolate strawberry'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 4 | widget4 | brown | strawberry chocolate | thirteen | willow |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> This query returns rows containing chocolate AND strawberry in the flavor column. Only row 4 contains matches for both queries.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=name,number', 'query=*3|three'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 1 | widget1 | blue | chocolate | 1 2 3 | black cherry |\n  | 2 | widget2 | red | spinach | three fifty | maple |\n  | 3 | widget3 | rainbow | strawberry | fourty two | spruce |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> Searches across the name and number columns for a value either ending in '3', or containing \"three\". Row 1 contains 3 in the number field matching the first query, row 3 has a name of \"widget3\", matching the first query, and row 2 has a number containing three, matching the second query.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Request:</b> 'query_fields=*', 'query=1|2|3 th*'\n  <b>Response:</b>\n  | id | name | color | flavor | number | tree |\n  | ---|------|-------|--------|--------|----- |\n  | 2 | widget2 | red | spinach | three fifty | maple |\n  | 3 | widget3 | rainbow | strawberry |  thirty | spruce |\n  <b>Explanation:</b> Searches across all columns, looking for rows where a row both contains either 1 and/or 2 and/or 3, and contains a value starting with \"th\". Row 1 contains a value matching 1 or 2 or 3, but has no column that begins with th. Similarly, row 4 has a value beginning with \"th\", but does not contain 1 or 2 or 3. Therefore only rows 2 and 3 are returned, which match both queries.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  ### Cross-Field Query Errors\n  ONTAP Error Response Codes\n  | Error Code | Description | HTTP Code |\n  | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |\n  | 262272 | The specified query contains an unmatched quote. | 400 |\n  | 262273 | Both 'query_fields' and 'query' must be specified if either one is specified. | 400 |\n  | 262274 | The specified query is either empty or is equivalent to an empty query. | 400 |\n  | 262274 | The parameters 'query_fields' and 'query' may only be specified for GET requests. | 400 |\n  | 262275 | At least one field must be specified for the cross-field query. | 400 |\n  | 262276 | A field was specified twice for the 'query_fields' parameter. | 400 |\n</details>\n<details id=\"Requesting_specific_fields\">\n  <summary>Requesting specific fields</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  By default, calling GET on a collection generally returns only the properties that uniquely identify the record, along with a HAL 'self' link to the resource instance. However, you can choose the specific fields you want using the `fields` parameter. The `fields` parameter can also be used with GET when retrieving a single resource instance.\n  <br/>For discovery purposes, except for the CLI passthrough, the client can retrieve all standard properties using `fields=\\*`. These are the same properties returned when a GET is called on the specific instance using the path keys. However, using `fields=\\*` is more expensive than selecting only the specific fields that are needed. In addition, because future releases may include additional properties in this list, or remove properties that were included by default, we strongly discourage using this in client-side software that is depending on specific fields being returned.\n  <br/>Some fields are more expensive to retrieve and are not included when using `fields=\\*` (or the instance-level GET). These fields are noted in the documentation. They can be returned either by specifying the fields directly, or by using `fields=\\*\\*`. However, we again strongly discourage this from being encoded into any client-side software. The performance of client software will suffer if a future version of ONTAP adds support for additional expensive properties.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  fields=<field>[,...]\n  ```\n  <br/>The `fields` input parameter allows you to specify exactly which fields you want to be returned.\n  ### Objects with fields\n  When an API contains fields that are objects, an entire object can be specified to return every field within the object. Individual fields within the object can be specified using dotted notation, as demonstrated below. Occasionally, some APIs might not support specifying fields nested within certain objects. Note: Dotted notation for arrays does not include array indices.\n  ### Examples\n  ```\n  {\n    \"a\": \"<string>\",\n    \"b\": {\n      \"c\": \"<string>\",\n      \"d\": \"<string>\"\n    },\n    \"e\": [\n      {\n        \"f\": \"<string1>\",\n        \"g\": \"<string1>\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"f\": \"<string2>\",\n        \"g\": \"<string2>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  Example `fields` query:\n  ```\n  fields=a,b     // Fetch a, b.c, and b.d\n  fields=a,b.c,e // Fetch a, b.c, e.f, and e.g\n  fields=b.d     // Fetch b.d\n  fields=e.f     // Fetch e.f\n  fields=b,!b.c  // Fetch b.*, but not b.c\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Records_and_pagination\">\n  <summary>Records and pagination</summary>\n  ### Records\n  Several query parameters control the return of records.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  return_records=<true|false>\n  ```\n  <br/>The default setting for `return_records` is `true` for GET calls and `false` for all other methods. When `false`, the array of records is not returned.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  return_timeout=<0..120 seconds>\n  ```\n  <br/>The `return_timeout` parameter specifies the number of seconds the cluster spends performing an operation before returning. The allowed range is `0` to `120` seconds. If the timeout is reached, GET calls return the records collected along with a pagination link. Other methods return and complete asynchronously. See Non-blocking-operations for more details.\n  <br/>The default setting for `return_timeout` is `15` seconds for GET calls. For all other methods it is `0` seconds. This means that these calls might execute asynchronously in order to return as fast as possible.\n  <br/>Note: If the `order_by` parameter is specified, the operation might take longer because the collection is sorted before it is returned.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  max_records=<number of records>\n  ```\n  <br/>The `max_records` parameter limits the number of records that are returned (or acted on) before providing the \"next\" pagination link.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  offset=<offset from the first record>\n  ```\n  <br/>The `offset` parameter determines how many records to skip over prior to returning the first record.\n  <br/>For example, if you have a total of 15 records, and specify an offset of 10, only records 11-15 inclusive will be returned. When combined with a query or sorting specification, the offset will apply after the query or sorting, meaning that you will get records beginning at the Nth record, taking into account the query and sort order. Note that the cost of skipping over N records is likely as great as actually returning those N records.\n  ### Pagination\n   All calls to GET on a resource collection allow you to page through the results. If the `max_records` parameter is not specified, the cluster returns as many records as possible within the `return_timeout` time threshold. The number of records returned can be further limited by specifying a value for the `max_records` parameter. When the operation reaches either the `return_timeout` or the `max_records` threshold, it stops and returns the records as well as a HAL link that can be used to get the next page of records. It is possible for a pagination link to be returned even if there are no additional records. This occurs because the cluster does not check if there is an additional record before returning when it reaches a threshold. When there are potentially additional records, the response header will also contain a `Link` header containing the link followed by `rel=\"next\"`.\n  <br/>The following is an example of the \"next\" link, which returns with a collection of records:\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  \"_links\": {\n      \"next\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/aggregates?start.aggregate=aggr25&max_records=25\"\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n  ### Count only\n  The response to collection operations includes a `num_records` field. By passing `return_records=false` with a GET call, you can retrieve the number of records without returning the records themselves. However, if either the `return_timeout` or `max_records` threshold is reached, an incomplete or partial number of records is returned and the \"next\" link must be called to retrieve additional record counts. All the partial counts must be added together to calculate the total count.\n</details>\n<details id=\"Record_sorting\">\n  <summary>Record sorting</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  By default, records in a collection are returned in the order defined by the object. You can change the order by specifying the `order_by` query parameter. Most uses of the `order_by` parameter collect and reorder _all records_ in the collection. This can be expensive when the collection is large. Therefore, clients are discouraged from paginating through the results with `max_records` when using `order_by`.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  order_by=<field [asc|desc]>[,...]\n  ```\n  <br/>If you want to sort on multiple fields (where the prior key value is the same), separate any fields (and optional direction) with a comma.\n  <br/>By default, sorting is done in ascending order based on the field type's ordering. If `desc` is specified after a field name, that field is sorted in descending order. Combining this with `max_records` allows you to see the `top` or `bottom` records based on the value of the specified field(s). When using this `top` or `bottom` functionality, queries on certain fields might require more time to search the entire collection regardless of the number of records actually returned.\n  <br/>Important Notes:\n  * When you use the `order_by` parameter, the `return_timeout` might be exceeded because the collection is sorted before it is returned.\n  * Using `order_by` on either a property of type array, or a nested property within an array (not including the records array), returns the records in an unspecified order.\n  ### Examples\n  ```\n  # Sort the volume collection from largest to smallest by size:\n  GET /api/storage/volumes?order_by=size desc\n  # Find the top 5 applications using the most IOPS:\n  GET /api/application/applications?order_by=statistics.iops.total desc,name asc&max_records=5\n  # Find the top 10 applications using the most space and then\n  # if multiple applications are using the same space, sort them by IOPS:\n  GET /api/application/applications?order_by=statistics.space.used desc,statistics.iops.total desc&max_records=10\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Response_body\">\n  <summary>Response body</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  Every API call returns a top-level JSON object. These JSON objects includes GET calls that contain an array of records. This nesting technique allows metadata about the resource or resource collection to be returned as well as each resource instance.\n  <br/>GET calls that return an array of records can contain the following top-level elements:\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  {\n    \"records\": [ {}, ... ]\n    \"num_records\": <N>\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": ...\n      },\n      \"next\": {\n        \"href\": ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  * `records` - The array of records.\n  * `num_records` - The number of records in the array.\n  * `_links` - Links to relevant APIs, possibly including:\n    * `self` - A link to retrieve the same data again.\n    * `next` - If there are potentially more records, a link to retrieve the next page of records.\n  ### Custom response bodies\n  Some APIs might include additional top-level elements. For example, some APIs may include a top-level `errors` array which can include errors if the array of records is incomplete (for reasons other than pagination). See the documentation for each API to check for custom top-level elements.\n  ### Error objects\n  When an error occurs, an error object is returned in the response body. The `target` element is returned when ONTAP determines the error is due to a specific input field that you've supplied.\n  <br/>\n  ```\n  \"error\": {\n     \"message\": \"<string>\",\n     \"code\": <integer>[,\n     \"target\": \"<string>\"]\n  }\n  ```\n  <br/>\n  ONTAP Error Response Codes\n  | Error Code | Description | HTTP Code |\n  | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |\n  | 1 | An entry with the same identifiers already exists. | 409 |\n  | 2 | A field has an invalid value, is missing, or an extra field was provided. | 400 |\n  | 3 | The operation is not supported. | 405 |\n  | 4 | An entry with the specified identifiers was not found. | 404 |\n  | 6 | Permission denied. | 403 |\n  | 7 | Resource limit exceeded. | 503 |\n  | 8 | Resource in use. | 409 |\n  | 65541 | RPC timed out. | 500 |\n  | 65552 | Generic RPC failure. | 500 |\n  | 65562 | Internal RPC error | 500 |\n  | 262177 | Missing value. | 400 |\n  | 262179 | Unexpected argument.

They are implemented as non-blocking operations. Any API call that is expected to return in less than `2` seconds is considered _synchronous_. Synchronous operations ignore the `return_timeout` parameter.\n  ### API response\n  If the `return_timeout` is less than the time it takes for an operation to complete, the server returns the code `202 Accepted` after waiting for the specified `return_timeout` seconds. The default `return_timeout` for non-blocking operations is `0` seconds, meaning the operation returns as fast as possible. However, the operation never returns the success code `200 OK`, but instead returns either an error or the code `202 Accepted`.\n  ### The Location header\n  When a POST operation that is creating a resource returns `201 Created` (synchronous) or `202 Accepted` (asynchronous), the response header includes the `Location` of the resource. For asynchronous operations, a GET call on this resource link may return code `404 Not Found` until the operation successfully completes. Use the returned job link instead of the Location link to determine when the asynchronous operation is complete. POST operations that return code `200 OK` do not populate the Location header.\n  ### Tracking non-blocking operations\n  Non-blocking or asynchronous operations are executed using _jobs_. The response to a non-blocking operation includes information about the job performing the operation, including a HAL link to the job resource. The job record also includes `state` and `message` fields. The `message` field indicates the progress of the operation while the `state` field indicates `running`. When a job is successful, the `state` and `message` fields indicate `success`. If an operation fails for any reason, the job's `state` reports `error`, and the `message` describes the problem that the operation encountered.\n  <br/>For POST operations, when a job is successfully completed, you can use the link from the `Location` header of the original response to retrieve the resource.\n  <br/>See [`GET /cluster/jobs`](#/cluster/job_get)<br/>\n</details>\n<details id=\"HTTP_status_codes\">\n  <summary>HTTP status codes</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  The following supported HTTP status codes are returned by ONTAP:\n  * 200 OK: Returned for success when not creating a new object\n  * 201 Created: Returned for success after the creation of an object\n  * 202 Accepted: Returned when a job has been successfully started, but the operation is not complete\n  * 400 Bad Request: Returned if the input could not be parsed\n  * 401 Unauthorized: Returned if user authentication failed\n  * 403 Forbidden: Returned for authorization (RBAC) errors\n  * 404 Not Found: Returned when the specified resource does not exist\n  * 405 Method Not Allowed: Returned when the specified resource does not support the method (for example, POST or DELETE calls)\n  * 409 Conflict: Returned when there is a conflict with a different object that must be created, modified, or deleted before this operation can succeed\n  * 500 Internal Error: Returned for most other internal error codes\n  * 503 Service Unavailable: Returned if the server is temporarily overloaded. Try again later.\n</details>\n<details id=\"HTTP_methods\">\n  <summary>HTTP methods</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  The ONTAP REST API supports the following HTTP methods:\n  * GET: Supported on all collections to retrieve the records\n  * POST: When supported, calls on a collection to create the supplied resource\n  * PATCH: When supported, calls on a specific resource to update the supplied properties\n  * DELETE: When supported, calls on a specific resource to delete the resource\n  * HEAD: Supported wherever GET is supported. It makes a GET call, but only returns the HTTP headers\n  * OPTIONS: Supported on every endpoint so that you can determine which HTTP methods are supported\n</details>\n<details id=\"Size_properties\">\n  <summary>Size properties</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  Many objects contain properties related to various sizes. Examples can be found in the `aggregate` object, `volume` object, `lun` object and `nvme_namespace` object. These properties are documented as type `integer`.<br/>\n  Unless otherwise documented, all sizes are reported in GET in bytes.<br/>\n  Depending on the development language-specific code generation, the API typically also requires an integer value in bytes for POST and PATCH input as well.<br/>\n  Where a string value is accepted, such as query parameters and ad-hoc curl requests, any of the following suffixes can be used to specify different units:<br/>\n  | Suffix | Definition |\n  | ------ | ------- |\n  | KB | kilobytes (1024 bytes, aka kibibytes) |\n  | MB | megabytes (KB x 1024, aka mebibytes) |\n  | GB | gigabytes (MB x 1024, aka gibibytes) |\n  | TB | terabytes (GB x 1024, aka tebibytes) |\n  | PB | petabytes (TB x 1024, aka pebibytes) |\n</details>\n<details id=\"SVM_tunneling\">\n  <summary>SVM tunneling</summary>\n  ### Overview\n  SVM tunneling allows for the scoping of REST APIs to any SVM from the cluster admin SVM interface. The HTTP headers \"X-Dot-SVM-Name\" and/or \"X-Dot-SVM-UUID\" are an alternative to supplying svm.name and/or svm.uuid in the request query or body. This allows for setting a context for an HTTP connection and reusing it for multiple calls. The cluster management interface or node management interface can be used instead of the desired SVM's interface. <br/>\n  ### Examples\n  <br/>Creates a new volume on SVM \"vs0\":\n  ```\n  curl  -H \"X-Dot-SVM-Name:vs0\" -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/volumes\" -d '{\"name\":\"vol1\",\"aggregates\":[{\"name\":\"aggr1\"}]}'\n  {\n    \"job\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"b271e19d-c5cb-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/b271e19d-c5cb-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  <br/>Retrieves all volumes on SVM \"vs0\":\n  ```\n  curl -H \"X-Dot-SVM-Name:vs0\" -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/volumes\"\n  {\n    \"records\":[\n     {\n       \"uuid\":\"a61e474-929a-4c78-882a-b72986ccf276\",\n       \"name\":\"root_vs0\",\n       \"_links\":{\n         \"self\":{\n           \"href\":\"/api/storage/volumes/aa61e474-929a-4c78-882a-b72986ccf276\"\n         }\n       }\n     },\n     {\n       \"uuid\":\"b26c64f5-c5cb-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\",\n       \"name\":\"vol1\",\n       \"_links\":{\n         \"self\":{\n           \"href\":\"/api/storage/volumes/b26c64f5-c5cb-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\"\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   ],\n   \"num_records\": 2,\n   \"_links\": {\n     \"self\":{\n       \"href\":\"/api/storage/volumes\"\n      }\n    }\n   }\n  ```\n  <br/>Deletes a volume on SVM \"vs0\" using the X-Dot-SVM-UUID header:\n  ```\n  curl -H \"X-Dot-SVM-UUID:85ebedff-c43e-11e9-bc27-005056ac2211\" -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/volumes?name=vol1\"\n  {\n    \"jobs\":[\n      {\n        \"uuid\":\"4acf3f58-c5d2-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\",\n        \"_links\":{\n          \"self\":{\n            \"href\":\"/api/cluster/jobs/4acf3f58-c5d2-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"num_records\": 1,\n    \"_links\":{\n      \"self\":{\n        \"href\":\"/api/storage/volumes?name=vol1\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  <br/>Retrieves all IP interfaces on SVM \"vs3\":\n  ```\n  curl -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Dot-SVM-Name:vs3\" -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ip/interfaces\"\n  {\n    \"records\":[\n      {\n        \"uuid\":\"83aeeac9-c5d8-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\",\n        \"name\": \"vs3_data_1\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"uuid\":\"9c612bc0-c5a5-11e9-b97d-005056ac2211\",\n        \"name\":\"vs3_data\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"num_records\": 2\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n<details id=\"Using_the_private_CLI_passthrough_with_the_ONTAP_REST_API\">\n  <summary>Using the private CLI passthrough with the ONTAP REST API</summary>\n  ### REST API access to CLI commands\n  To help CLI and ONTAP users transition to the ONTAP REST API, ONTAP provides a private REST API endpoint that can be used to access any CLI command. Usage of this API call is recorded and returned in the AutoSupport data collection so that NetApp can identify usablity and functionality improvements in the REST API for future releases. There is no per-API documentation for the REST API access for each CLI command. Unlike the documented REST APIs, the API paths and properties for the CLI passthrough correspond very closely to the CLI. There are several rules that govern all the differences between a CLI command and the REST API mirroring the CLI command.\n  #### Rules for path differences when accessing a CLI command through the REST API\n  The API paths mirror the CLI paths, except for the use of the \"show\", \"create\", \"modify\", and \"delete\" verbs. Instead of using these four CLI verbs in the REST API, the corresponding HTTP methods must be used (GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE). The four CLI verbs are removed from the API path supporting a command. For any commands where the last verb is hyphenated and begins with one of these verbs (for example, \"show-space\" or \"delete-all\"), you must remove the verb and following hyphen from the path. Any space in a full command path becomes a forward slash in the REST API (for example, \"system node\" becomes \"/api/private/cli/system/node\"). For non-show CLI commands that use non-standard verbs, the POST method should be used on the full path with the final verb in the API path. For example, \"volume rehost\" becomes \"POST /api/private/cli/volume/rehost\" and \"cluster add-node\" becomes \"POST /api/private/cli/cluster/add-node\".\n  <br/>To know which HTTP methods are supported for an API call, both documented and CLI-based, clients can use the \"OPTIONS\" HTTP method. For example, using OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/volume\" returns 'OK' with the HTTP \"Allow\" header containing a list of the supported HTTP methods (for example, \"Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, DELETE, PATCH\"). For feature-specific CLI verbs, you can use OPTIONS on the API path. For example, using OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/volume/restrict\" returns with the HTTP header \"Allow: OPTIONS, POST\". Some of the CLI \"show\" commands do not contain the standard verb. For example, calling OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/cluster/add-node-status\" returns \"Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS\".\n  <br/>There are some commands in the CLI that will not work using REST APIs. This includes most show commands that do not support \"show -fields\" in the CLI. The REST API also does not support CLI commands that create a new shell (like \"run\" and \"vserver context\").\n  <br/>Here are several examples of mappings from the ONTAP CLI to the ONTAP REST API for the /api/private/cli path:\n  * volume show       &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/volume\n  * volume create     &rarr; POST /api/private/cli/volume\n  * volume modify     &rarr; PATCH /api/private/cli/volume\n  * volume delete     &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/volume\n  * volume restrict   &rarr; POST /api/private/cli/volume/restrict\n  * volume show-space        &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/volume/space\n  * volume show-footprint    &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/volume/footprint\n  * cluster add-node         &rarr; POST /api/private/cli/cluster/add-node\n  * cluster add-node-status  &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/system/node/add-node-status\n  * system node coredump show       &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump\n  * system node coredump delete     &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump\n  * system node coredump delete-all &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump/all\n  #### Rules for field differences when accessing a CLI command through the REST API\n  All CLI parameters are supported in the CLI-based REST APIs. However, REST converts hyphens (-) in CLI parameter names to underscores (_) in the REST API JSON response body. In general, REST API responses use the same formatting for property values as ONTAPI. For example, enumerated values are formatted in lowercase instead of uppercase and with underscores instead of hyphens in the REST API response body. Both CLI and ONTAPI formats are allowed on input. Also similar to ONTAPI, sizes and percentages in REST are encoded as integers in bytes. Unlike ONTAPI or the CLI, date and time values in REST are encoded with the ISO-8601 format. All fields that you want returned from the GET call must be specified using the `fields` parameter. Note that the /api/private/cli/... APIs do not support \"fields=*\".\n  ### Examples\n  Retrieve OPTIONS for volumes endpoint (with results contained in header):\n  ```\n  curl -X OPTIONS \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume\" --include\n  Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, DELETE, PATCH\n  {\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>GET size and percent-used for all volumes:\n  ```\n  curl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?fields=size,percent-used&pretty=false\"\n  {\n    \"records\": [\n      { \"vserver\": \"vs1\", \"volume\": \"vol1\", \"size\": 20971520, \"percent_used\": 73 },\n      { \"vserver\": \"vs1\", \"volume\": \"vol2\", \"size\": 20971520, \"percent_used\": 87 },\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>GET size and percent-used for a specific volume:\n  ```\n  curl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?volume=vol2&pretty=false\"\n  {\n    \"records\": [\n      { \"vserver\": \"vs1\", \"volume\": \"vol2\", \"size\": 209715203864, \"percent_used\": 89 },\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>POST a new volume with all required attributes:\n  ```\n  curl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume\" -d '{\"volume\":\"vol3\",\"vserver\":\"vs0\",\"aggregate\":\"aggr1\"}'\n  {\n    \"job\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"f7b5f5cb-54a2-11e9-930a-005056ac6a3f\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f7b5f5cb-54a2-11e9-930a-005056ac6a3f\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"cli_output\": \"[Job 36] Job is queued: Create vol2.\"\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>Attempt to DELETE an online volume:\n  ```\n  curl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?vserver=vs1&volume=vol1\"\n  {\n    \"num_records\": 0,\n    \"error: {\n      \"message\": \"Volume vol1 in Vserver vs1 must be offline to be deleted.\",\n      \"code\": \"917658\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>PATCH a volume to become offline:\n  ```\n  curl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?vserver=vs1&volume=vol1\" -d '{ \"state\": \"offline\" }'\n  {\n    \"num_records\": 1,\n    \"cli_output: \"Volume modify successful on volume vol1 of Vserver vs1.\\n\"\n  }\n  ```\n  <br>DELETE the offline volume:\n  ```\n  curl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?vserver=vs1&volume=vol1\"\n  {\n    \"jobs\": [\n      {\n        \"uuid\": \"3f35a934-4b40-11e9-9f4d-005056bbf4eb\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/3f35a934-4b40-11e9-9f4d-005056bbf4eb\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"num_records\": 1,\n    \"cli_output\": \"[Job 1243] Job succeeded: Successful\\n\"\n  }\n  ```\n  Note: When POST is called for a command that uses a job, the REST API does not wait for the job to complete, unless `return_timeout` is specified. However, PATCH and DELETE calls on the command path (using queries on key fields in the query portion of the URI) wait up to 15 seconds for the operation to complete if the `return_timeout` parameter is not specified.\n  <br>DELETE an offline volume without waiting:\n  ```\n  curl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?vserver=vs1&volume=vol2&return_timeout=0\"\n  {\n    \"jobs\": [\n      {\n        \"uuid\": \"a7138c5e-4b69-11e9-9f4d-005056bbf4eb\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/a7138c5e-4b69-11e9-9f4d-005056bbf4eb\",\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"num_records\": 1,\n    \"cli_output\": \"[Job 1247] Job is queued: Delete vol1.\\n\"\n  }\n  ```\n  ### CLI message output\n  As shown in the previous example, any non-field and non-error based output that would have appeared in the CLI is returned in a top-level `cli_output` attribute in the response body. This does not contain normal CLI headers or field values. It only displays messages that were printed to the CLI.\n  ### HTTP status codes\n  Error codes in the response body are mapped to the most appropriate HTTP status codes. In cases where this is not done, the HTTP status code defaults to 500. This does not necessarily indicate that the error is internal to ONTAP.\n  ### Security\n  All CLI-based REST APIs are RBAC-controlled, based on the role of the authenticated user and have the same protections they have in the CLI.\n  ### Location of CLI fields for CLI-based REST APIs:\n  * POST APIs: All CLI fields must be provided in the request body.\n  * GET APIs: All desired CLI fields (except keys) must be specified in the `fields` parameter. The non-key fields returned via the CLI will not be returned if not requested. The client can also provide a query for any field.\n  * PATCH APIs: The client can provide a query for any field, but at least one field must have a query. To modify only a single record, all CLI keys must contain an exact query. All new values for the object must be provided in the request body.\n  * DELETE APIs: The client can provide a query for any field, but at least one field must have a query. To delete only a single record, all CLI keys must contain an exact query. Non-attribute inputs (such as `force`) must be provided in the query portion of the URI.\n</details>\n"},"securityDefinitions":{"simple":{"type":"basic"}},"swagger":"2.0","produces":["application/json","application/hal+json"],"consumes":["application/json","application/hal+json"],"definitions":{"software_status_details_reference":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"object","properties":{"end_time":{"format":"date-time","example":"2019-02-02T19:00:00Z","x-nullable":"1","x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"End time for each status phase.","readOnly":"1"},"start_time":{"format":"date-time","example":"2019-02-02T19:00:00Z","x-nullable":"1","x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"Start time for each status phase.","readOnly":"1"},"name":{"example":"initialize","x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"Name of the phase to be retrieved for status details.","readOnly":"1"},"action":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"object","readOnly":"1","properties":{"message":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.7","type":"string","description":"Corrective action to be taken to resolve the status error."},"code":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.8","type":"integer","description":"Error code corresponding the status error"}}},"node":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"object","properties":{"name":{"example":"node1","x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"Name of the node to be retrieved for status details.","readOnly":"1"}}},"state":{"example":"failed","enum":["in_progress","waiting","paused_by_user","paused_on_error","completed","canceled","failed","pause_pending","cancel_pending"],"x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"Status of the phase","readOnly":"1"},"issue":{"x-ntap-introduced":"9.7","type":"object","readOnly":"1","properties":{"message":{"example":"Image update complete","x-ntap-introduced":"9.7","type":"string","description":"Update status details"},"code":{"example":"10551399","x-ntap-introduced":"9.8","type":"integer","description":"Error code corresponding to update status"}}}}},"security_style":{"enum":["unix","ntfs","mixed"],"x-ntap-introduced":"9.6","type":"string","description":"Security style.

Some can also be used to manage networking.\n<br/>\n---\n## IPspaces\nIPspaces enable you to configure a single ONTAP cluster so that it can be accessed by clients from more than one administratively separate network domain, even if those clients are using the same IP address subnet range. This allows for separation of client traffic for privacy and security.<br/>\nAn IPspace defines a distinct IP address space in which storage virtual machines (SVMs) reside. Ports and IP addresses defined for an IPspace are applicable only within that IPspace. A distinct routing table is maintained for each SVM within an IPspace, so that no cross-SVM or cross-IPspace traffic routing occurs.\n<br/>\n---\n## Ethernet\n### Broadcast Domains\nA broadcast domain is a set of ports which would all receive a broadcast packet that is sent from any of the ports.<br/>\nBy accurately representing the physical network with an ONTAP broadcast domain, ONTAP ensures that IP interfaces are able to migrate to appropriate ports in case of failure. ONTAP also ensures that characteristics, such as MTU, stay matched across all ports of the broadcast domain.<br/>\nA broadcast domain resides in an IPspace, and can be used by cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped IP interfaces in that IPspace. The scope of the broadcast domain's uniqueness is the IPspace it is in. You must create as many broadcast domains in an IPspace as there are IP subnets with interfaces in that IPspace.<br/>\nPorts are mapped to an IPspace by assigning the port's broadcast domain.\n### Ports\nA port is a physical or virtual Ethernet network device. Physical ports may be combined into Link Aggregation Groups (LAGs, or ifgrps), or divided into Virtual LANs (VLANs).<br/>\nThe GET and PATCH APIs are available for all port types. The POST and DELETE APIs are available for \"lag\" and \"vlan\" port types.<br/>\nA given port can host zero or more IP interfaces.<br/>\nA port exists in a broadcast domain and all ports within the same broadcast domain must have layer 2 network connectivity to one another. If a port within a broadcast domain goes down, any IP interfaces hosted by that port can fail over to other ports in the same broadcast domain.\n <br/>\n---\n## Fibre Channel\n### Interfaces\nFibre Channel (FC) interfaces are the logical endpoints for Fibre Channel network connections to an SVM. A Fibre Channel interface provides Fibre Channel access to storage within the interface's SVM using either Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) or Non-Volatile Memory Express over Fibre Channel (NVMe over FC).<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel interface REST API allows you to create, delete, update and discover Fibre Channel interfaces and obtain status information for Fibre Channel interfaces.<br/>\nA Fibre Channel interface is created on a Fibre Channel port that is located on a cluster node. The Fibre Channel port must be specified to identify the location of the interface for a POST or PATCH that relocates an interface. You can identify the port by either supplying the node and port names or the port UUID.\n### Ports\nFibre Channel ports are the physical ports of Fibre Channel adapters on ONTAP cluster nodes that can be connected to Fibre Channel networks to provide Fibre Channel network connectivity. A Fibre Channel port defines the location of a Fibre Channel interface within the ONTAP cluster.<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel port REST API allows you to discover Fibre Channel ports, obtain status information for Fibre Channel ports, and configure Fibre Channel port properties.\n### Learn More\n* _Fibre Channel Logins_ found in both the _SAN_ and _NVMe_ sections. Fibre Channel logins represent connections formed by Fibre Channel initiators that have successfully logged in to ONTAP.\n---\n## IP\n### Interfaces\nAn interface (also referred to as a _LIF_ in ONTAP documentation) represents a network access point to a node in a cluster. In other words, an interface is essentially an IPv4 or IPv6 address with associated attributes.<br/>\nIP interfaces are configured on ports to send and receive communications over the network. The port that will host the interface can either be explicitly specified using node and/or port fields or implicitly specified using a broadcast domain.<br/>\nThe IPspace of the interface is required for cluster-scoped interfaces. The SVM owning the interface is required for SVM-scoped interfaces. These interfaces are in the SVM's IPspace.<br/>\nThe service policy of an interface defines what network services are provided by the interface.\n### Routes\nRoutes indicate which IPv4 or IPv6 gateway to use to communicate with hosts that are not on the local subnet. Typically, an IP interface (or LIF) can only use a gateway if it has the same address family and is in the LIF's subnet.<br/>\nIt is important that every gateway address belongs to a physical or virtual router that has connectivity to the specified destination network.<br/>\nSVM-scoped routes can only be used by IP interfaces of the specified SVM. Likewise, cluster-scoped routes can only be used by cluster-scoped IP interfaces in the specified IPspace.\n### Service Policies\nService policies are named groupings that define what services are supported by an IP interface. These include both built-in service policies (for example: default-data-files or default-management) and custom service policies.<br/>\nService policies are scoped to either an SVM or IPspace.\n<br/>\n---\n","name":"networking","description":"Manages physical and logical networking"},{"x-ntap-long-description":"## Overview\nStorage Virtual Machine (SVM) APIs enable you to manage SVMs and their attributes, including the configuration of the CIFS and NFS protocols, export policies, name mappings between CIFS and NFS users, and network services.\n<br/>SVMs contain data volumes and one or more network interfaces through which they serve data to the clients. SVMs securely isolate the shared virtualized data storage and network, and each SVM appears as a single dedicated server to the clients. Each SVM has a separate administrator authentication domain, and each SVM can be managed independently by its SVM administrator.\n<br/>In a cluster, SVMs facilitate data access. A cluster must have at least one SVM to serve data. Multiple SVMs can coexist in a single cluster without being bound to any particular node in the cluster. However, they are bound to the physical cluster on which they exist.\n<br/>SVMs with volumes can contain files and LUNs. They provide file-level data access by using NFS and CIFS protocols for the NAS clients, and block-level data access by using iSCSI and Fibre Channel (FC) (FCoE included) for SAN hosts. The volumes within each NAS SVM are related to each other through junctions and they are mounted on junction paths. These junctions present the file system in each volume. The root volume of the SVM resides at the top level of the namespace hierarchy; additional volumes are mounted to the SVM root volume to extend the namespace. As volumes are created for the SVM, the root volume of the SVM contains junction paths.\n<br/>The ONTAP REST APIs only expose data SVMs as an SVM. The information and configuration associated with the cluster and nodes are exposed from REST, but the cluster and nodes are not treated as if they are a type of SVM from REST APIs. Some APIs that expose both cluster-owned resources and SVM-owned resources from the same endpoint only return and support the \"svm\" sub-object for the resources that are within a data SVM. In those endpoints, the resources that are not in a data SVM do not return the \"svm\" sub-object. Generally, such endpoints have a \"scope\" attribute that returns either \"svm\" or \"cluster\" to identify the resource as either a cluster-level resource or one that is completely contained in a data SVM.\n","name":"svm","description":"Manages storage virtual machines (SVMs)"},{"x-ntap-long-description":"## Overview\nONTAP uses name-services to obtain information about users and clients.

This application-specific terminology can be used to provision and manage ONTAP storage objects. A single call using application-specific parameters provisions storage and enables protocol access for an application following NetApp best practices. You can view and manage the ONTAP objects making up the application as a group using the application APIs. The library of available application templates already includes several database and virtualization applications.\n## APIs\nThere are several application APIs that must be used to fully manage an application. Templates are used to represent any parameters specific to a given application. Some APIs expose applications in terms of their specific template, while others only expose a generic view that all applications share. The template view is present on the _templates_ and _applications_ APIs (although these APIs do also include some generic fields). The _components_ and _snapshots_ APIs are entirely generic and do not differ across types of applications.\n<br/>The following section provides an overview of each API, followed by a lifecycle example of managing an application to demonstrate how the APIs can be used together.\n***\n### Template\nA template is an ONTAP representation of a specific type of application. Each template represents one type of application, the parameters that can be used to customize it, the layout of its storage, and how it can be accessed. Templates are intended to expose an application in terms specifically applicable to an administrator of a given application. As such, traditional ONTAP storage elements are generally not included in an application template.\n<br/>The template APIs can be used to discover what templates are currently available. The ONTAP API documentation also includes a model of the templates. The template APIs generally provide the same information as the documentation, but the template APIs might provide more up-to-date details about the default values of template parameters based on the current ONTAP configuration. However, only the ONTAP API documentation includes a full description of each template parameter, its usage, and whether it is optional.\n***\n### Application\nThe application APIs are the only interfaces that allow management of an application using template properties.\n<br/>The application object includes the following three sections:\n1. Generic metadata about the application, including common fields such as the name of the application, the template used to provision it, and the generation number of the application.\n2. Statistics information about the application, including space and IOPS details about the entire application and each of its components. These are expensive to collect and should only be requested when needed using a _fields=_ query.\n3. A template view of the application. The application object itself presents a mutually exclusive list of all possible templates. Only one of these fields can be used per application. The name of the field corresponds to the name of the template used by the application. Currently, the creation of a new application and the modification of the storage service for an existing application are supported through the template parameters.\n***\n### Component\nThe component API offers a generic view of the application and how to access the application from the host application. This is the only API that exposes the underlying ONTAP storage elements of which the application is composed. It is read-only; it cannot support modifications specific to the type of application it is presenting.\n<br/>The component object includes the following details for an application:\n1. The NFS export rules for accessing the application from the host.\n2. The CIFS share and users that can access the application from the host.\n3. The SAN initiators that can access the application from the host.\n4. For IP-based protocols, the IP addresses that are best suited for accessing the component.\n5. The underlying storage elements that make up the component, such as volumes or LUNs.\n***\n### Snapshot copy\nThe Snapshot copy APIs offer full CRUD for application-level Snapshot copies. Application Snapshot copies can be flagged as either crash-consistent or application-consistent. From the perspective of ONTAP, there is no difference between the two. It is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the application is in a consistent state before flagging a Snapshot copy as application-consistent. Use of the SnapCenter Backup Management suite is recommended to ensure correct interaction between host applications and ONTAP.\n***\n## Example\nThe following example outlines the APIs necessary to manage applications and how they fit together. However, this example does not provide detailed information on each API. See the documentation for the individual APIs for more information.\n### 1) Discover the templates\nThis documentation, which includes the model of each template as part of the _templates_ and _applications_ APIs, is the easiest and most comprehensive way to discover the available templates. The _templates_ API can also be used to query the system for templates in a programmatic way.<br/>\nTo discover the templates available to provision an Oracle application, the following query is used.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/templates\n# The query:\nname=oracle*\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/templates?name=oracle*\" -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_on_nfs\", \"description\": \"Oracle using NFS.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_on_san\", \"description\": \"Oracle using SAN.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_rac_on_nfs\", \"description\": \"Oracle RAC using NFS.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_rac_on_san\", \"description\": \"Oracle RAC using SAN.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 4\n}\n```\n---\n### 2) Create an application\nNow that we know the possible templates, we use one to create an application. The template properties differ from template to template, and can be found by exploring the model of the application object in this documentation. Each call to create an application must include the properties for exactly one template. These properties are provided under the property with the same name as the template. Other than the template properties, the only other required properties to create an application are the SVM and name.\n<br/>Note: In the following call example, not all of the template properties are included. Where a property is not needed or the default is sufficient, the property can be excluded. In this case using the _oracle_on_nfs_ template, the _archive_log_, and _protection_type_ are not included. The template name, _oracle_on_nfs_, is specified above the group of template properties, after the names of the application and the SVM.\n<br/>Creating an application is asynchronous, so the response for this API includes information about the job doing the work. The response header also includes the _location_ of where the application can be found if the job is successful.\n---\nPrior to creating an application, the following prerequisites must be met for the protocols associated with the template:\n* Licences must be installed.\n  * [`POST /cluster/licensing/licenses`](#cluster/license_create)\n* Aggregates must exist with enough available space and IOPS to satisfy the requested size.\n  * [`POST /storage/aggregates`](#storage/aggregate_create)\n* An SVM must exist with protocol services enabled.\n  * [`POST /svm/svms`](#svm/svm_create)\n* LIFs must exist. For SAN applications, only High Availability groups where each node has at least on LIF will be considered for placement of storage objects.\n  * [`POST /network/ip/interfaces`](#networking/network_ip_interfaces_create)\n  * [`POST /network/fc/interfaces`](#networking/fc_interface_create)\n---\nThe following are not required prior to creating an application, but might be necessary before connecting to the application:\n* Network routes must be created to access ethernet based LIFs.\n  * [`POST /network/ip/routes`](#networking/network_ip_routes_create)\n* For volumes created by this operation to be successfully mounted, ONTAP requirements related to mounting must be met.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications\n# The query:\nNo query is needed for this command. Optionally, you can specify the return_timeout or set the return_records flag to alter the behavior of the command.\n# The body:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my_ora_app\",\n  \"svm\": {\n    \"name\": \"svm1\"\n  },\n  \"oracle_on_nfs\": {\n    \"db\": {\n      \"size\": \"2GB\",\n      \"storage_service\": {\n        \"name\": \"value\"\n      },\n      \"nfs_access\": [\n          {\n              \"access\": \"rw\",\n              \"host\": \"0.0.0.0/0\"\n          }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"redo_log\": {\n      \"size\": \"1GB\"\n    },\n    \"ora_home\": {\n      \"size\": \"1GB\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n# The call:\n      curl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H \"content-type: application/json\" -d '{ \"name\": \"my_ora_app\", \"svm\": { \"name\": \"vs1\" }, \"oracle_on_nfs\": { \"db\": { \"size\": \"2GB\", \"storage_service\": { \"name\": \"value\" }, \"nfs_access\": [ { \"access\": \"rw\", \"host\": \"0.0.0.0/0\" } ] }, \"redo_log\": { \"size\": \"1GB\" }, \"ora_home\": { \"size\": \"1GB\" } } }'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"dc0d01dd-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\",\n    \"id\": 94,\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/dc0d01dd-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n# The response header:\ndate: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 16:38:18 GMT\nserver: libzapid-httpd\ncontent-type: application/hal+json\nlocation: /api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\ncache-control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nconnection: Keep-Alive\nkeep-alive: timeout=5, max=100\ncontent-length: 203\n```\n---\n### 3) Wait for the application to be created\nThe call to create the application returns information about the job, including a HAL link to retrieve details about the job. The job object includes a state and a message to indicate the progress of the job. When the job is complete, and the application has been fully created, the message indicates success and the _state_ of the job property is _success_.\n<br/>For brevity purposes, the successful job response is shown here. On a real cluster, an application might take several seconds to several minutes to be created, depending on the system load. If the job is not complete, the _message_ property includes a short description on the progress of the job, and the _state_ indicates _running_.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/jobs/{uuid}\n# The call, provided by the HAL link from step 3:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/dc0d01dd-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"dc0d01dd-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\",\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Complete: Success [0]\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/dc0d01dd-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### 4) Retrieve the new application\nYou can look up the application directly without listing all the applications. Use the _location_ header that is included in the response when the application is created.\n<br/>Note: The following example uses a query to retrieve only a small number of the application's properties.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{uuid}\n# The query:\nfields=name,template.name,generation,state\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2?fields=name,template.name,generation,state\" -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\",\n  \"name\": \"my_ora_app\",\n  \"template\": { \"name\": \"oracle_on_nfs\" },\n  \"generation\": 2,\n  \"state\": \"online\"\n}\n```\n---\n### 5) Discover how to access the application\nThe components API provides information on how to access the storage that is provisioned for the application.\n<br/>For brevity, only the names of the components are requested. See the API documentation for more information on the other available fields.\n---\n```\n# The API:\napi/application/applications/{application.uuid}/components\n# The query:\nfields=name\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2/components?fields=name\" -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    { \"uuid\": \"e06fb407-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\", \"name\": \"db\" },\n    { \"uuid\": \"e0709732-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\", \"name\": \"ora_home\" },\n    { \"uuid\": \"e07158eb-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\", \"name\": \"redo_log\" }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 3\n}\n```\n---\n### 6) Update the application\nTo update the storage service, the same template that is used for creating the application is reused, but with only the storage_service properties set. In the generic SAN and NAS templates, the name of each component must also be specified.\n<br/>In this example, the cluster only supports the _value_ storage service, so modifications of the application to a faster storage service fail. Note how the error message indicates the parameter that caused the problem.\n<br/>Application modification, like application creation, is an asynchronous operation. If a valid command is passed, the API returns information about the job instead of an error.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{uuid}\n# The body:\n{\n  \"oracle_on_nfs\": { \"db\": { \"storage_service\": { \"name\": \"extreme\" } } }\n}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H \"content-type: application/json\" -d '{ \"oracle_on_nfs\": { \"db\": { \"storage_service\": { \"name\": \"extreme\" } } } }'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"message\": \"Invalid value for parameter \\\"oracle_on_nfs.db.storage-service.name\\\": extreme. Supported values are: value.\",\n    \"code\": \"65995152\"\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### 7) Manage Snapshot copies\nFor applications created with the _local_ _protection_type_ set to _hourly_, Snapshot copies are automatically taken every hour. These Snapshot copies can be retrieved or restored using the Snapshot copy APIs. Snapshot copies can also be taken on demand using these APIs. It is important to note that the _consistency_type_ flag of the Snapshot copy is for record-keeping only: it is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the application is in a consistent state prior to flagging a Snapshot copy as _application_ consistent.\n<br/>Take a Snapshot copy manually:\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{uuid}/snapshots\n# The body:\n{\n    \"name\": \"little_bobby_tables\",\n    \"consistency_type\": \"crash\"\n}\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2/snapshots\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H \"content-type: application/json\" -d '{ \"name\": \"little_bobby_tables\", \"consistency_type\": \"crash\"}'\n# The response:\n{}\n# The response header:\ndate: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 17:40:10 GMT\nserver: libzapid-httpd\ncontent-type: application/hal+json\nlocation: /api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2/snapshots/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2_13_little_bobby_tables\ncache-control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nconnection: Keep-Alive\nkeep-alive: timeout=5, max=100\ncontent-length: 3\n```\n---\nIn the above example, the response body is empty, and the response header includes the _location_ of the newly created Snapshot copy. By default, all POST calls return an empty body unless a job is used to process the creation asynchronously. This behavior can be changed with the query flag _return_records_.\n<br/>Restoring a Snapshot copy uses an action API. Action paths can also be performed asynchronously as jobs, as with creating or modifying an application. The response header does not include a _location_, because this action is not creating a resource.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{application.uuid}/snapshots/{snapshot.uuid}/restore\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2/snapshots/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2_13_little_bobby_tables/restore\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"00e81690-df64-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\",\n    \"id\": 100,\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/00e81690-df64-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n# The response header:\ndate: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 17:43:46 GMT\ncache-control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nserver: libzapid-httpd\nconnection: Keep-Alive\nkeep-alive: timeout=5, max=100\ncontent-length: 204\ncontent-type: application/hal+json\n```\n---\n## Smart containers\nSmart containers are traditional ONTAP storage objects such as FlexVol or FlexGroup created using the application REST API.\n* NAS - FlexVolume, FlexGroup, and FlexCache objects\n* SAN - LUNs\n* NVME - Namespaces\n* S3 - Object Store S3 Buckets\n---\nThe benefits of creating a Smart Container are as follows:\n* ONTAP determines the best placement for the storage object based on available performance and space capacity.\n* Access controls can be optionally set.\n* Snapshot copy schedules can be optionally set.\n* A single atomic job that does all the above.\n***\nSmart containers are similar to generic enterprise applications (NAS, SAN, NVME), but with certain restrictions. Smart containers are restricted to 1 application-component. Any post-provisioning data management operations on smart containers must be performed via PATCH operations corresponding to the object created. However, the POST, GET and DELETE operations that exist for applications will also operate for smart containers.\n<br/>To create a Smart Container the \"smart_container:true\" parameter must be provided.<br/>\n---\nPrior to creating a smart container, the following prerequisites must be met for the protocols associated with the template:\n* Licences must be installed.\n  * [`POST /cluster/licensing/licenses`](#cluster/license_create)\n* Aggregates must exist with enough available space to satisfy the requested size.\n  * [`POST /storage/aggregates`](#storage/aggregate_create)\n* An SVM must exist with protocol services enabled.\n  * [`POST /svm/svms`](#svm/svm_create)\n* LIFs must exist.

All applications can be represented in generic terms as a list of components. Each component generally maps to a field in the template. For example, Microsoft SQL Server applications have a component named _sqldata_ that corresponds to the _db_ parameter in the sql_on_san template. These mappings are usually straightforward and allow the templates to present application terminology, while the generic view uses the traditional naming schemes for ONTAP storage elements.\n<br/>The current release supports the creation and modification of applications in template terms, but retrieval is not supported. The mapping from template to generic terms is left to your own discretion.za\n### ONTAP feature support\nApplication APIs are interfaces layered on top of traditional ONTAP storage. While the intent is to provide a full management suite through application APIs, some features of the underlying ONTAP objects are not directly supported through application APIs. Applications are provisioned using ONTAP best practices, so the need for additional modifications of the underlying objects should be minimal. If such modifications are necessary, the traditional ONTAP APIs can be used. The _/api/application/{application.uuid}/components_ API provides a _backing_storage_ field that can be used to locate the storage objects associated with an application. This API also provides details of the NFS, CIFS, or SAN protocol access objects associated with the application.\n<br/>The application APIs use the extra information known about the application to coordinate multiple ONTAP objects in unison. When using non-application APIs, certain settings might interfere with the ONTAP object coordination and cause the application APIs to behave unexpectedly. To continue to supply the full ONTAP feature set, these modifications on the underlying objects are allowed, but there is no guarantee that these modifications will not adversely affect the application experience. You should use this feature with caution.\n","name":"application","description":"Manages applications"},{"x-ntap-long-description":"## Overview\nYou can use ONTAP support APIs to manage configuration backups, autosupport settings, and event handling.\n### Configuration backups\nConfiguration backups are copies of node and cluster settings saved to an external server.\nSingle-node clusters must have configuration backups as protection against corruption of the configuration database.

The primary objective of this feature is to provide storage-enforced WORM and retention functionality. SnapLock can be deployed for protecting data in strict regulatory environments in such a way that even the storage administrator is considered an untrusted party. SnapLock provides special purpose volumes in which files can be stored and committed to a non-erasable, non-rewritable state either forever or for a designated retention period.

You can delete or update NFS configurations, and you can also disable or enable different NFS features as needed.\nThe export APIs allow you to create and manage export policies for an SVM that enable an administrator to restrict access to volumes for clients that match specific IP addresses and specific authentication types. Export APIs are also used to create export rules for an export policy. The APIs allow each rule to specify the number of mask bits in the client IP address that must be matched for that rule to apply to a particular client request. The APIs also allow each export rule to specify the authentication types that are required for both read-only and read-write operations.\n### Kerberos\nKerberos is a protocol designed to provide strong authentication for users and hosts within a client/server environment. The basis of the protocol is a shared, secret-key cryptology system. (Kerberos uses shared-key encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the data. It also uses hashing techniques to ensure the integrity of the data (so that no one can modify the data unless allowed to do so). With the NetApp multiprotocol storage platform, through which clients based on UNIX or Windows can access data using CIFS or NFS, it is crucial to provide the ability to use standard network services for authentication and for identity storage.<br/>\nTo configure an ONTAP system to use Kerberos for NFS, Kerberos must be enabled on a data LIF in the SVM that owns the NFS server. A Kerberos realm needs to be created before enabling Kerberos on a data LIF. (The Kerberos realm is needed so that the cluster knows how to format Kerberos ticket requests.) The Kerberos APIs allow you to define, create, modify, and delete realms for the SVM. The APIs also allow you to enable/disable Kerberos on a data LIF and update the Kerberos interface configuration for a particular data LIF in the SVM.\n","name":"NAS","description":"Manages the NFS and export settings for clusters and SVMs"}],"paths":{"/protocols/san/fcp/services":{"x-ntap-long-description":{"description":"## Overview\nA Fibre Channel Protocol (FC Protocol) service defines the properties of the FC Protocol target for an SVM.

System owned root aggregates are not included in the output.\nThis API also supports specific queries, in addition to queries on aggregate body properties, which affect the output of the API. The parameters\nfor these queries are \"recommend\" and \"show_spares\". Using the \"recommend\" query returns the list of aggregates that are\nrecommended for creation in the cluster. The \"show_spares\" query returns a response outside of the records body, which includes the groups\nof usable spares in the cluster. The usable count for each class of spares does not include reserved spare capacity recommended by ONTAP best practices.</br>\nThe collection GET returns the aggregate identifiers, UUID and name, and the node on which the aggregate resides. The instance GET, by default, returns all of the properties defined in the aggregates object, except advanced properties.\nThe properties \"space.footprint\" and \"space.block_storage.inactive_user_data\" are considered advanced properties and only returned when requested\nusing the \"fields\" query parameter. Performance \"metric\" and \"statistics\" for aggregates are also only returned when requested. The \"statistics\" property accounts for the cumulative raw values collected by ONTAP for an aggregate, while the \"metric\" property displays the incremental average for latency and incremental changes in IOPs and throughput over the last 15 seconds. Any external application can use the raw statistics to derive its own incremental performance metrics.\nThe collection GET does not support queries in conjunction with the \"order_by\" parameter.\n## Creating storage aggregates\nWhen the POST command is issued with no properties, the system evaluates the cluster attached storage, determines the optimal aggregate layout and configures the aggregates. This layout is completely controlled by the system.\nTo view the recommended optimal layout rather than creating it, use the GET endpoint, setting the \"recommend\" query to 'true'. This response will also include any warnings related to any inefficiencies in the storage configuration.\nRecommended aggregate creation is not supported on ONTAP Cloud and MetroCluster with Fibre Channel (FC).\nAlternatively, POST can be used with specific properties to create an aggregate as requested. At a minimum, the\naggregate name, disk count, and the node where it should reside are required if any properties are provided.</br>\nWhen using POST with input properties, three properties are required. These are:\n- name\n- node.name or node.uuid\n- block_storage.primary.disk_count\n### Remaining properties are optional\nThe following properties can be specified in POST:\n* name - Name of the aggregate.\n* node.name and node.uuid - Node on which the aggregate will be created.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_count - Number of disks to be used to create the aggregate.\n* block_storage.mirror.enabled - Specifies whether or not the aggregate should be created using SyncMirror.\n* block_storage.primary.checksum_style - Checksum style of the disks to be use for the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_class - Class of disks to be use to for the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_size - Desired RAID size of the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_type - Desired RAID type of the aggregate.\n* snaplock_type - SnapLock type to use on the aggregate.\n* data_encryption.software_encryption_enabled - Enable or disable NAE (NetApp Aggregate Encryption) on the aggregate.\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of aggregates from the cluster\nThe following example shows the response with a list of data aggregates in the cluster:\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/aggregates\" -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c\",\n      \"name\": \"test1\",\n      \"node\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"caf95bec-f801-11e8-8af9-005056bbe5c1\",\n        \"name\": \"node-1\",\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"4a7e4139-ca7a-420b-9a11-3f040d2189fd\",\n      \"name\": \"test4\",\n      \"node\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"4046dda8-f802-11e8-8f6d-005056bb2030\",\n        \"name\": \"node-2\",\n      },\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n}\n```\n### Retrieving a list of aggregates recommended for creation from the cluster\nThe following example shows the response with a list of recommended data aggregates in the cluster.

If you supply the optional broadcast domain property, the specified broadcast domain will be assigned to the new port immediately.

An FC port defines the location of an FC interface within the ONTAP cluster.<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel port REST API allows you to discover FC ports, obtain status information for FC ports, and configure FC port properties. POST and DELETE requests are not supported. You must physically add and remove FC adapters to ONTAP nodes to create and remove ports from the ONTAP cluster.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of an FC port can be monitored by observing the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These properties show the performance of an FC port in terms of IOPS, latency, and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average, whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving all FC

When creating an application, only a single template is used, so it is best to focus only on the template of interest. Other than the properties for the chosen template, only the `name` and `svm` of the application must be provided. The following three sections provided guidelines on using the properties of the templates, but the whole idea behind the templates is to automatically follow the best practices of the given application, so the only way to determine the exact list of required properties and default values is to dig in to the model section of the template. The templates are all top level properties of the application object with names matching the values returned by [`GET /application/templates`](#operations-application-application_template_collection_get).\n### Required properties\n* `svm.uuid` or `svm.name` - The existing SVM in which to create the application.\n* `name` - The name for the application.\n* `<template>` - Properties for one template must be provided. In general, the following properties are required, however the naming of these may vary slightly from template to template.\n  * `name` - The generic templates require names for the components of the application. Other templates name the components automatically.\n  * `size` - This generally refers to the size of an application component, which may be spread across multiple underlying storage objects (volumes, LUNs, etc...).\n  * One of the following must be specified:\n      * `nfs_access` or an identifier (name or id) of an existing `export-policy`.\n      * `cifs_access`\n      * `igroup_name`\n  * `os_type` - All SAN applications require an os_type to be specified in some way. Some templates refer to this as the `hypervisor`.\n### Recommended optional properties\n* `<template>` - The following properties are available in some templates.\n  * `new_igroups.*` - SAN applications can use existing initiator groups or create new ones. When creating new initiator groups, `new_igroups.name` is required and the other properties may be used to fully specify the new initiator group.\n### Default property values\nIf not specified in POST, the follow default property values are assigned. It is recommended that most of these properties be provided explicitly rather than relying upon the defaults. The defaults are intended to make it as easy as possible to provision and connect to an application.\n* `template.name` - Defaults to match the `<template>` provided. If specified, the value of this property must match the provided template properties.\n* `<template>` - The majority of template properties have default values. The defaults may vary from template to template. See the model of each template for complete details. In general the following patterns are common across all template properties. The location of these properties varies from template to template.\n  * `storage_service.name` - _value_\n  * `protection_type.local_rpo` - _hourly_ (Hourly Snapshot copies)\n  * `protection_type.remote_rpo` - _none_ (Not MetroCluster)\n  * `new_igroups.os_type` - Defaults to match the `os_type` provided for the application, but may need to be provided explicitly when using virtualization.\n### Optional components\nA common pattern across many templates are objects that are optional, but once any property in the object is specified, other properties within the object become required. Many applications have optional components. For example, provisioning a database without a component to store the logs is supported. If the properties related to the logs are omitted, no storage will be provisioned for logs. But when the additional component is desired, the size is required. Specifying any other property of a component without specifying the size is not supported. In the model of each template, the required components are indicated with a red '*'. When a `size` property is listed as optional, that means the component itself is optional, and the size should be specified to include that component in the application.\n### POST body examples\n1. Create a generic SAN application that exposes four LUNs to an existing initiator group, _igroup_1_.<br/>\n    ```\n    {\n      \"name\": \"app1\",\n      \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\n      \"san\": {\n        \"os_type\": \"linux\",\n        \"application_components\": [\n          { \"name\": \"component1\", \"total_size\": \"10GB\", \"lun_count\": 4, \"igroup_name\": \"igroup_1\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n2. Create an SQL application that can be accessed via initiator _iqn.2017-01.com.example:foo_ from a new initiator group, _igroup_2_.<br/>\n    ```\n    {\n      \"name\": \"app2\",\n      \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\n      \"sql_on_san\": {\n        \"db\": { \"size\": \"5GB\" },\n        \"log\": { \"size\": \"1GB\" },\n        \"temp_db\": { \"size\": \"2GB\" },\n        \"igroup_name\": \"igroup_2\",\n        \"new_igroups\": [\n          { \"name\": \"igroup_2\", \"initiators\": [ \"iqn.2017-01.com.example:foo\" ] }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n3. The following body creates the exact same SQL application, but manually provides all the defaults that were excluded from the previous call. Note: The model of a _sql_on_san_ application documents all these default values.<br/>\n    ```\n    {\n      \"name\": \"app3\",\n      \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\n      \"template\": {

There are two types of policies that can be configured: fixed, which defines a fixed SLO, or adaptive which defines a variable SLO for a storage object. Adaptive policies vary the SLO depending on the space usage of the storage object. A policy can be either a fixed policy or an adaptive one, not both.\n<br />\nService level objectives include minimum and maximum limits on throughput in terms of IOPS. Only maximum limits can be set in terms of both IOPS and/or throughput (MB/s). A QoS policy can be used to enforce SLOs for multiple storage objects by specifying \"capacity_shared\" to true. For example, if a QoS policy with \"capacity_shared\" is set to true and it has maximum_throughput_iops set to 1000, and this policy is assigned to four volumes, then the combined throughput of all four volumes is limited to 1000 IOPS. If \"capacity_shared\" is set to false then, each storage object will have it's SLOs enforced individually. For example, in the previous case if the same policy was applied to four volumes but with \"capacity_shared\" set to false, then each of the volumes would be limited to 1000 IOPS individually. Once \"capacity_shared\" is set, it cannot be modified.\n<br />\nAdaptive parameters can specify the variable SLOs in terms of IOPS/TB. The actual IOPS enforced on the storage object can be calculated using the allocated space on the storage object. The policies are enforced individually amongst storage objects.\n## Examples\n### 1) Create a fixed QoS policy\nThe following example shows how to create a fixed QoS policy to limit throughput for a storage object between 5000 IOPS and 10000 IOPS which has capacity_shared set to false. This QoS policy can be used as a template to apply on multiple storage objects to provide individual SLOs to each object.\n<br />\n---\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://172.21.69.245/api/storage/qos/policies?return_timeout=0\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{ \\\"fixed\\\": { \\\"capacity_shared\\\": false, \\\"max_throughput_iops\\\": 10000, \\\"min_throughput_iops\\\": 5000 }, \\\"name\\\": \\\"qos_policy_5000_to_10000_iops\\\", \\\"svm\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vs0\\\" }}\"\n```\n---\n### 2) Create an adaptive QoS policy\nThe following example shows how to create an adaptive QoS policy which provides 5000 IOPS per GB of allocated space for a storage object with a peak of 6000 IOPS.

ONTAP SNMP client uses a remote SNMPv3 user to query the switch over SNMPv3.\n## Examples\n### Retrieves a list of SNMP users in the cluster, sorted by SVM UUID\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nGET \"/api/support/snmp/users\"\n# The call:\ncurl -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/snmp/users?order_by=owner.uuid\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"engine_id\": \"80000315052d7d2c4410b8e911bc9f005056bb942e\",\n      \"name\": \"snmpv1user1\",\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"442c7d2d-b810-11e9-bc9f-005056bb942e\"\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/snmp/users/80000315052d7d2c4410b8e911bc9f005056bb942e/snmpv1user1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"engine_id\": \"80000315058e02057c0fb8e911bc9f005056bb942e\",\n      \"name\": \"snmpv3user1\",\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"7c05028e-b80f-11e9-bc9f-005056bb942e\"\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/snmp/users/80000315058e02057c0fb8e911bc9f005056bb942e/snmpv3user1\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/support/snmp/users?order_by=owner.uuid\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n<br/>\n### Creates an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community user\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/support/snmp/users\"\n# The call\ncurl -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/snmp/users\" -d '{\"owner\":{\"uuid\":\"02c9e252-41be-11e9-81d5-00a0986138f7\", \"name\":\"cluster1\"}, \"name\":\"public\", \"authentication_method\":\"community\"}'\n# The response:\n201 Created\n{}\n```\n### Creates a local SNMPv3 user\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/support/snmp/users\"\n# The call\ncurl -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/snmp/users\" -d '{\"owner\":{\"uuid\":\"02c9e252-41be-11e9-81d5-00a0986138f7\", \"name\":\"cluster1\"}, \"name\":\"snmpv3u1\", \"authentication_method\":\"usm\", \"snmpv3\":{\"authentication_protocol\":\"sha\", \"authentication_password\":\"jelly22fi$h\", \"privacy_protocol\":\"aes\", \"privacy_password\":\"a11Black$\"}}'\n# The response:\n201 Created\n{}\n```\n### Creates a remote SNMPv3 user\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/support/snmp/users\"\n# The call\ncurl -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/snmp/users\" -d '{\"owner\":{\"uuid\":\"02c9e252-41be-11e9-81d5-00a0986138f7\", \"name\":\"cluster1\"}, \"engine_id\":\"8000031505b67667a26975e9118a480050568e6f74\", \"name\":\"switchuser1\", \"authentication_method\":\"usm\", \"switch_address\":\"fdf8:f53b:82e4::53\", \"snmpv3\":{\"authentication_protocol\":\"md5\", \"authentication_password\":\"TfhIeliw601lS.Rw$3pm\"}}'\n# The response:\n201 Created\n{}\n```\n","tags":["support"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/snmp_user"},"description":"Info specification"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

In the initial version, only a subset of the protocol features necessary to support Fabric Pool capacity tier usecases are implemented. S3 server allows you to store objects in ONTAP using Amazon S3 protocol. This feature can be used as a target object store server for ONTAP FabricPools.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of the SVM can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These show the performance of the SVM in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving all of the S3

It needs this information to obtain user credentials and provide proper file access regardless of whether they are connecting from an NFS client or a CIFS client. </br>\nThe system keeps a set of conversion rules for each Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). Each rule consists of two pieces: a pattern and a replacement. Conversions start at the beginning of the appropriate list and perform a substitution based on the first matching rule. The pattern is a UNIX-style regular expression. The replacement is a string containing escape sequences representing subexpressions from the pattern, as in the UNIX sed program.</br>\nName mappings are applied in the order in which they occur in the priority list; for example, a name mapping that occurs at position 2 in the priority list is applied before a name mapping that occurs at position 3. Each mapping direction (Kerberos-to-UNIX, Windows-to-UNIX, and UNIX-to-Windows) has its own priority list.

The scope of the management operation can be at the cluster level or at an individual SVM level. There is a need to create user accounts with specific privileges apart from the default user accounts, \"admin\", for cluster and \"vsadmin\" for SVM. Custom user accounts can be configured to perform specific (scoped) operations. User accounts can either be created locally (on the Netapp system) or referenced from an external directory server (NIS, LDAP, or Active Directory).\nApart from creation, modification, and deletion of a user account, locking and unlocking of a user account or resetting the password (for local accounts only) is possible.<br/>\nA user account must be associated with the following before it can become operational:<p/>\n1. A management application (SSH, HTTP, console, service_processor, and such like) for user login. HTTP enables REST API access.\n2. Scope - either cluster or SVM.\n3. Authentication source - password (local, NIS/LDAP, Active Directory), public/private key pair-based, certificate based.\n4. RBAC role - determines what operations are permitted for the user account.<p/>\n### Restrictions\nA number of internal/restricted account names, such as admin, diag, autosupport, and root cannot be used.<p/>\nThere must be at least one console cluster administrator account. Any attempt to delete the last remaining administrator account fails.<p/>\nMulti-factor authentication is only possible for SSH application and the only combination possible is password (local or NIS/LDAP) and public key.<p/>\nAll authentication sources are not supported by all applications. You must select a compatible authentication method based on the application. The following types of authentications methods are supported:<p/>\n| Application       | Supported Authentication Methods |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| console           | password |\n| service_processor | password |\n| HTTP              | password, domain, nsswitch, certificate |\n| ONTAPI            | password, domain, nsswitch, certificate |\n| SSH               | password, publickey (key pair), domain, nsswitch |\n<br/>\nNote: In this table, \"certificate\" means security certificate, \"domain\" means that the user directory server is an external Active Directory, \"nsswitch\" means the directory server is an external NIS or LDAP server. At login time, the user is authenticated with these external directory servers which must be provisioned separately.<p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating a cluster-scoped user account\nSpecify the user account name, role name, and the tuples (of application and authentication methods) in the body of the POST request. The owner.uuid or owner.name are not required to be specified for a cluster-scoped user account.<br/>\nNote: Each entry in the applications array must be for a different application.\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/accounts\"\n# The call to create a cluster user account with applications ssh, http and password authentication scheme:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts\" -d '{\"name\":\"cluster_user1\",\"applications\":[{\"application\":\"ssh\",\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"],\"second_authentication_method\":\"none\"},{\"application\":\"http\",\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"]}],\"role\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"p@ssw@rd123\"}'\nNote: The password is an optional parameter for creation and can be set later using a PATCH request. See the examples for modification of user account or password.\n```\n### Creating an SVM-scoped user account\nFor an SVM-scoped account, specify either the SVM name as the owner.name or SVM uuid as the owner.uuid along with other parameters for the user account. These indicate the SVM for which the user account is being created and can be obtained from the response body of GET performed on the <i>/api/svm/svms</i> API.\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/accounts\"\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts\" -d '{\"owner\":{\"uuid\":\"aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"},\"name\":\"svm_user1\",\"applications\":[{\"application\":\"ssh\",\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"],\"second_authentication_method\":\"none\"}],\"role\":\"vsadmin\",\"password\":\"p@ssw@rd123\"}'\n```\n### Retrieving the configured user accounts\nUse the following API to retrieve all of the user accounts or a filtered list of user accounts (by name, for a specific SVM, and so on).\n```\n# The API:\nGET \"/api/security/accounts\"\n# The call to retrieve all the user accounts configured in the cluster:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\",\n        \"name\": \"cluster1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"admin\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25/admin\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\",\n        \"name\": \"cluster1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"autosupport\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25/autosupport\"\n              }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\",\n        \"name\": \"cluster1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"cluster_user1\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts/2903de6f-4bd2-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25/cluster_user1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"svm_user1\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts/aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25/svm_user1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"vsadmin\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts/aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25/vsadmin\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 5,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/security/accounts\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n# The scoped call to retrieve the configured cluster-scoped user accounts:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts/?scope=cluster\"\n# The scoped call to retrieve the configured SVM-scoped user accounts:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts/?scope=svm\"\n# The scoped call to retrieve the user accounts configured for the SVM \"svm1\":\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts/?owner.name=svm1\"\n# The scoped call to retrieve the user accounts configured with the \"admin\" role:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts/?role=admin\"\n```\n","tags":["security"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/account"},"description":"Details for the user account to be created."},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

Additionally, a SnapMirror relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint or a failed over SnapMirror relationship can be failed back to the original state or a SnapMirror relationship direction can be reversed using this API.\n<br>To initialize the relationship, PATCH the state to \"snapmirrored\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"in_sync\" for relationships with a policy of type \"sync\".\n<br>To break the relationship or to failover to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint, PATCH the state to \"broken_off\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"sync\". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as \"sync\" and sync_type as \"automated_failover\" cannot be \"broken_off\".\n<br>To resync the broken relationship, PATCH the state to \"snapmirrored\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"in_sync\" for relationships with a policy of type \"sync\".\n<br>To failback the failed over relationship and start serving data from the source endpoint, PATCH the state to \"snapmirrored\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"in_sync\" for relationships with a policy of type \"sync\" and set the query flag \"failback\" as \"true\". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as \"sync\" and sync_type as \"automated_failover\" can be in \"broken_off\" state due to a failed attempt of automated SnapMirror failover operation.\n<br>To pause the relationship, suspending further transfers, PATCH the state to \"paused\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"sync\". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as \"sync\" and sync_type as \"automated_failover\" cannot be \"paused\".\n<br>To resume transfers for a paused relationship, PATCH the state to \"snapmirrored\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"in_sync\" for relationships with a policy of type \"sync\".\n<br>To reverse the direction of the relationship, PATCH the \"source.path\" with the destination endpoint and the \"destination.path\" with the source endpoint and the relationship state to \"snapmirrored\" for relationships with a policy of type \"async\" or \"in_sync\" for relationships with a policy of type \"sync\".\n<br>The values \"in_sync\", \"out_of_sync\", and \"synchronizing\" are only applicable to relationships with a policy of type \"sync\".\n### Related ONTAP commands\n* `snapmirror modify`\n* `snapmirror initialize`\n* `snapmirror resync`\n* `snapmirror break`\n* `snapmirror quiesce`\n* `snapmirror resume`\n### Examples\nThe following examples show how to perform the SnapMirror \"resync\", \"initialize\", \"resume\", \"quiesce\", and \"break\" operations. In addition, a relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint. A failed over relationship can be failed back to the source endpoint and serve data from the source endpoint. Also a relationship can be reversed by making the source endpoint as the new destination endpoint and the destination endpoint as the new source endpoint.\n<br/>\n   To update an associated SnapMirror policy.\n   <br/>\n   ```\n   PATCH \"/api/snapmirror/relationships/98bb2608-fc60-11e8-aa13-005056a707ff/\" '{\"policy\": { \"name\" : \"MirrorAndVaultDiscardNetwork\"}}'\n   ```\n   <br/>\n   To perform SnapMirror \"resync\" for an asynchronous SnapMirror relationship.\n   <br/>\n   ```\n   PATCH \"/api/snapmirror/relationships/98bb2608-fc60-11e8-aa13-005056a707ff/\" '{\"state\":\"snapmirrored\"}'\n   ```\n   <br/>\n   To perform SnapMirror \"initialize\" for an asynchronous SnapMirror relationship.\n   <br/>\n   ```\n   PATCH \"/api/snapmirror/relationships/98bb2608-fc60-11e8-aa13-005056a707ff/\" '{\"state\":\"snapmirrored\"}'\n   ```\n   <br/>\n   To perform SnapMirror \"resume\" for an asynchronous SnapMirror relationship.\n   <br/>\n   ```\n   PATCH \"/api/snapmirror/relationships/98bb2608-fc60-11e8-aa13-005056a707ff/\" '{\"state\":\"snapmirrored\"}'\n   ```\n   <br/>\n   To perform SnapMirror \"quiesce\" for an asynchronous SnapMirror relationship.\n   <br/>\n   ```\n   PATCH \"/api/snapmirror/relationships/98bb2608-fc60-11e8-aa13-005056a707ff\" '{\"state\":\"paused\"}'\n   ```\n   <br/>\n   To perform SnapMirror \"break\" for an asynchronous SnapMirror relationship.

This datastore can contain symbolic links which are files, created by UNIX clients. It contains a reference to another file or directory. If an SMB client accesses a symbolic link, it is redirected to the target file or directory that the symbolic link refers to. The symbolic links can point to files within the volume that contain the share, or to files that are contained in other volumes on the Storage Virtual Machine (SVM), or even to volumes contained on other SVMs.<p/>\nThere are two types of symbolic links:\n  * <b>Relative</b>  A relative symbolic link contains a reference to the file or directory relative to its parent directory. Therefore, the path of the file it is referring to should not begin with a backslash (/). If you enable symbolic links on a share, relative symbolic links work without UNIX symlink mapping.\n  * <b>Absolute</b> An absolute symbolic link contains a reference to a file or directory in the form of an absolute path. Therefore, the path of the file it is referring to should begin with a backslash (/). An absolute symbolic link can refer to a file or directory within or outside of the file system of the symbolic link. If the target is not in the same local file system, the symbolic link is called a \"widelink\". If the symbolic link is enabled on a share and absolute symbolic links do not work right away, the mapping between the UNIX path of the symbolic link to the destination CIFS path must be created. When creating absolute symbolic link mappings, locality could be either \"local\" or \"widelink\" and it must be specified. If UNIX symlink mapping is created for a file or directory which is outside of the local share but the locality is set to \"local\", ONTAP does not allow access to the target.\n</br>A UNIX symbolic link support could be added to SMB shares by specifying the <i>unix_symlink</i> property during the creation of SMB shares or at any time by modifying the existing SMB <i>unix_symlink</i> property. UNIX symbolic link support is enabled by default.<p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating a UNIX symlink mapping for CIFS shares\nTo create UNIX symlink mappings for SMB shares, use the following API.

For a successful request, the POST request returns a status code of 201.\nJob schedules can be of either type \"cron\" or type \"interval\". A cron schedule is run at specific minutes within the hour, or hours of the day, days of the week, days of the month, or months of the year. An interval schedule runs repeatedly at fixed intervals.\n### Required fields\n* name - Name of the job schedule\nYou are required to provide a \"minutes\" field for a cron schedule. An \"interval\" field is required for an interval schedule. Do not provide both a \"cron\" field and an \"interval\" field.\nThe schedule UUID is created by the system.\n### Cron schedule fields\n* cron.minutes - Minutes within the hour (0 through 59)\n* cron.hours -  Hours of the day (0 through 23)\n* cron.weekdays - Weekdays (0 through 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.)\n* cron.days - Days of the month (1 through 31)\n* cron.months - Months of the year (1 through 12)\n### Interval schedule field\n* interval - Length of time in ISO 8601 duration format.\n### Examples\n#### Create an interval schedule with a 1-week interval\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules\none_week_interval.txt:\n{\n    \"name\": \"test_interval_1\",\n    \"interval\": \"P1W\"\n}\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules\" -d \"@one_week_interval.txt\"\n# The response of a successful POST is empty.\n```\n#### Create a cron schedule that runs daily at 12:05\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules\ndaily_noon_job.txt:\n{\n    \"name\": \"test_cron_1\",\n    \"cron\":\n    {\n        \"minutes\": [ 5 ],\n        \"hours\": [ 12 ]\n    }\n}\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules\" -d \"@daily_noon_job.txt\"\n# The response of a successful POST is empty.\n```\n### Optional fields\nBy default, the schedule is owned by the local cluster. In a MetroCluster configuration, you can specify the partner cluster if the local cluster is in the switchover state.\n* cluster.name - Name of the cluster owning the schedule.\n* cluster.uuid - UUID of the cluster owning the schedule.\n### Records field\nYou can create multiple schedules in one request by providing an array of named records with schedule entries. Each entry must follow the required and optional fields listed above.\n<br/>\n---\n## Updating a job schedule\nThe following fields of an existing schedule can be modified:\n* cron.minutes\n* cron.hours\n* cron.weekdays\n* cron.days\n* cron.months\n* interval\nNote that you cannot modify the name, cluster, and type of schedule. Also, you cannot modify a cron field of an interval schedule, or the interval field of a cron schedule. You can apply queries on fields to modify all schedules that match the combined query.\n### Examples\n#### Modify an interval schedule with a 2-day and 5-minute interval\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\nevery_two_days_five_minutes.txt:\n{\n    \"interval\": \"P2DT5M\"\n}\n# The call:\ncurl  -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\" -d \"@every_two_days_five_minutes.txt\"\n# The response of a sucessful PATCH is empty.\n```\n#### Modify a cron schedule to run Mondays at 2\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\nmonday_at_two.txt:\n{\n    \"cron\":\n    {\n        \"hours\": [ 2 ],\n        \"weekdays\": [ 1 ]\n    }\n}\n# The call:\ncurl  -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\" -d \"@monday_at_two.txt\"\n# The response of a sucessful PATCH is empty.\n```\n---\n## Deleting a job schedule\nYou can delete job schedules based on their UUID. You can apply queries on fields to delete all schedules that match the combined query.\n### Example\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\"\n# The response of a successful DELETE of one schedule is empty.\n```\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/?name=test*\"\n# The response of a successful DELETE indicates the number of schedules affected:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/schedules?name=test*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n## MetroCluster configurations\nIn a MetroCluster configuration, user-created schedules owned by the local cluster are replicated to the partner cluster. Likewise, user-created schedules owned by the partner cluster are replicated to the local cluster. The owning cluster for a particular schedule is shown in the \"cluster.name\" and \"cluster.uuid\" fields.\nNormally, only schedules owned by the local cluster can be created, modified, and deleted on the local cluster. However, when a MetroCluster configuration is in switchover, the cluster in switchover state can create, modify, and delete schedules owned by the partner cluster.\n","tags":["cluster"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/schedule"},"description":"Info specification"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

There can be at most one NVMe service for an SVM. An SVM's NVMe service must be created before NVMe host initiators can connect to the SVM.<br/>\nThe Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) service REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover NVMe services for SVMs.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of the SVM can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These show the performance of the SVM in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Creating an NVMe service for an SVM\nThe simpliest way to create an NVMe service is to specify only the SVM, either by name or UUID. By default, the new NVMe service is enabled.<br/>\nIn this example, the `return_records` query parameter is used to retrieve the new NVMe service object in the REST response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/nvme/services\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services?return_records=true' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" } }'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving the NVMe services for all SVMs in the cluster\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/nvme/services\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\",\n        \"name\": \"svm0\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving details for a specific NVMe service\nThe NVMe service is identified by the UUID of its SVM.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n    \"name\": \"svm1\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Disabling an NVMe service\nDisabling an NVMe service shuts down all active NVMe connections for the SVM and prevents the creation of new NVMe connections.<br/>\nThe NVMe service to update is identified by the UUID of its SVM.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"enabled\": \"false\" }'\n```\n<br/>\nYou can retrieve the NVMe service to confirm the change.<br/>\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n    \"name\": \"svm1\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"enabled\": false,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Deleting an NVMe service\nThe NVMe service must be disabled before it can be deleted.

Parameters are provided in the body of the POST request.\n### Fields used for setting up a MetroCluster configuration\nThe fields used for MetroCluster APIs are either required or optional and are described as follows:\n### Required configuration fields\nThese fields are always required for any POST /cluster/metrocluster request.\n* `partner_cluster.name` - Specifies the partner cluster name to which cluster peering has been established.\n* `dr_pairs` - Specifies local and DR partner node pairs.  Each pair uniquely identifies a DR group.\n### Optional configuration fields\nThis field is used to set up additional components in a MetroCluster configuration.\n* `mediator.*` - Specifies mediator parameters. If Mediator Assisted Unplanned Switchover (MAUSO) functionality is required, then a mediator should be configured.\n* `vlans` - Specifies VLAN IDs and port combination for MetroCluster platforms supporting custom VLAN IDs.\n### Polling the setup job\nAfter a successful POST /cluster/metrocluster is issued, an HTTP status code of 202 (Accepted) is returned along with a job UUID and a link in the body of the response. The setup job continues asynchronously and can be monitored by using the job UUID and the /cluster/jobs API.

It is required that cluster peering be established between two clusters, in this example, site \"mcc_siteA\" and \"mcc_siteB\" before issuing the POST request. Nodes \"node-a\" and \"node-b\" are HA partners and part of the local cluster \"mcc_siteA\", wheres nodes \"node-c\" and \"node-d\" are HA partners in the partner cluster  \"mcc_siteB\". Specifying a single DR pairing of \"node-a\" and \"node-c\" is sufficient to identify a DR group -- \"node-a\" and \"node-c\" will be designated primary DR partners (\"node-b\" and \"node-d\" too). \"node-d\" will then be designated auxiliary partner of \"node-a\". Once the MetroCluster configuration has been completed, and since mediator parameters have been provided, the mediator will be setup and MAUSO enabled.\n# API\n/api/cluster/metrocluster\n```\n### POST

You can enable new features by purchasing a license from a NetApp sales associate. After installation of the license, the new feature is available immediately.\n####\nThis interface manages licenses according to their supported feature. By default, the interface displays packages with installed licenses, but you can also return unlicensed packages.\n####\nEach feature has a compliance state that is indicated at the package level. Individual licenses also contain a compliance state indicated in the \"licenses\" array. The state of the package is determined by analyzing the underlying licenses according to the following criteria:\n  * Licensing terms\n  * Cluster state\n### Licensing terms\nThe licensing terms define the conditions under which a package is considered \"compliant\". Individual licenses are evaluated based on the following:\n  * Scope\n  * Time period\n  * Usage\n  <br/>\n**Scope**\nA package can be licensed under the following scopes:\n  * Site - Permits the feature to be used by any node that is a member of the cluster.\n  * Cluster - Permits the feature to be used by any node that is a member of the cluster.\n  * Node - Permits the authorized node to use the feature. Within a cluster, if you don't supply every node with a valid license, the package state indicates \"noncompliant\". You must purchase a license for each node in a cluster for the package to be considered \"compliant\".\n  <br/>\n**Time period**\nSome package licenses are only valid for a limited period of time. After a license has expired, the package state changes to \"noncompliant\". You need to purchase a new license for the package to return to a \"compliant\" state.\n<br/>\n**Usage**\nSome package licenses have additional terms that need to be maintained to keep a license in compliance. These conditions are defined by the individual license. For example, a license might define the maximum amount of storage that a node can allocate for the license to be \"compliant\".\n### Cluster state\nA cluster's state consists of the following:\n  * Node online status\n  * Node cluster membership\n####\nSome features require that a node be online to display a valid compliance state. If a node cannot be reached or is not known to the cluster, the individual license might indicate an \"unknown\" state.\n<br/>\n---\n## Licensing keys\nA license is issued in one of the following two formats:\n  * 28-character key\n  * NetApp License File (NLF)\n####\nThe following is an example of a 28-character key:\n####\n  ```\n    AMEPOSOIKLKGEEEEDGNDEKSJDEEE\n  ```\n####\nThe following is an example of an NLF key:\n####\n```JSON\n{\n  \"statusResp\": {\n  \"version\": \"1\",\n  \"serialNumber\": \"123456789\",\n  \"message\": \"Success\",\n  \"licenses\": {\n    \"capacity\": \"1\",\n    \"type\": \"capacity\",\n    \"licenseProtocol\": \"FABRICPOOL-TB\",\n    \"package\": \"FabricPool\",\n    \"licenseScope\": \"cluster\"\n  },\n  \"snStatus\": \"Active\",\n  \"product\": \"fabricpool\",\n  \"statusCode\": \"S007\"\n  },\n  \"Signature\": \"signatureABC\"\n}\n```\n####\nYou can use this API to submit either format to enable features.\n####\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a collection of licenses organized by package\nThis example retrieves a collection that contains one entry for each package (filtered to only the 'fabricpool' package).\n####\n```JSON\n# API\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=fabricpool\"\n# Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"records\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"fabricpool\",\n    \"scope\": \"cluster\",\n    \"state\": \"compliant\",\n    \"licenses\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\": \"testcluster-1\",\n      \"serial_number\": \"4149027342\",\n      \"state\": \"compliant\",\n      \"capacity\": {\n      \"maximum_size\": 1099511627776,\n      \"used_size\": 0\n      }\n    }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/fabricpool\"\n    }\n    }\n  }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"_links\": {\n  \"self\": {\n    \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=fabricpool\"\n  }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Retrieving a collection of installed licenses\nThis example retrieves a collection containing all packages (except base) that have installed licenses.\n####\n```JSON\n# API\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=!base\"\n# Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"records\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"nfs\",\n    \"scope\": \"node\",\n    \"state\": \"compliant\",\n    \"licenses\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\": \"testcluster-1\",\n      \"serial_number\": \"1-81-0000000000000004149027492\",\n      \"state\": \"compliant\"\n    }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/nfs\"\n    }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"cifs\",\n    \"scope\": \"node\",\n    \"state\": \"compliant\",\n    \"licenses\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\": \"testcluster-1\",\n      \"serial_number\": \"1-81-0000000000000004149027492\",\n      \"state\": \"compliant\"\n    }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/cifs\"\n    }\n    }\n  }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n  \"self\": {\n    \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=!base\"\n  }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Retrieving a collection of unlicensed packages\nBy default, unlicensed packages are filtered from the collection output.

The GET operation retrieves all the DR groups in the MetroCluster over IP configuration or a DR group information specified by the DR group id. The POST request can be used to create a new DR group in the MetroCluster over IP configuration. The DELETE operation removes a DR group information specified by the DR group id from the existing MetroCluster over IP configuration.\n## Creating a new DR group\nA new DR group in MetroCluster over IP configuration is created by issuing a POST to /cluster/metrocluster/dr-groups. Parameters are provided in the body of the POST request.\nThis operation requires a valid MetroCluster over IP configuration. The new nodes added belong to either the local or partner cluster.\n### Fields used for setting up a new DR group\nThe fields used for MetroCluster APIs are either required or optional and are described as follows:\n### Required configuration fields\nThese fields are always required for any POST /cluster/dr-groups request.\n* `partner_cluster.name` - Specifies the partner cluster name to which cluster peering has been established.\n* `dr_pairs` - Specifies local and DR partner node pairs.  Each pair uniquely identifies a DR group.\n### Optional configuration fields\nThis field is used to set up additional MetroCluster DR configuration.\n* `vlans` - Specifies VLAN IDs and port combinations for MetroCluster platforms supporting custom VLAN IDs.\n### Polling the create job\nAfter a successful POST /cluster/metrocluster/dr-groups is issued, an HTTP status code of 202 (Accepted) is returned along with a job UUID and a link in the body of the response. The create job continues asynchronously and can be monitored by using the job UUID and the /cluster/jobs API. The \"message\" field in the response of the GET /cluster/jobs/{uuid} request shows the current step in the job, and the \"state\" field shows the overall state of the job.\n## Deleting a DR group using ID\nA DR group in MetroCluster over IP configuration can be deleted by issuing a DELETE to /cluster/metrocluster/dr-groups/{id}. No parameters are required for the DELETE request.\nThe following preparation steps must be completed on the local and partner clusters before removing a DR group.\n* Move all the data volumes to another DR group.\n* Move all the MDV_CRS metadata volumes to another DR group.\n* Delete all the MDV_aud metadata volumes that may exist in the DR group to be removed.\n* Delete all the data aggregates in the DR group to be removed. Root aggregates are not deleted.\n* Migrate all the data LIFs to home nodes in another DR group.\n* Migrate the cluster management LIF to a home node in another DR group. Node management and inter-cluster LIFs are not migrated.\n* Transfer epsilon to a node in another DR group.\nThe operation is refused if the preparation steps are not completed on the local and partner clusters.\n### Polling the delete job\nAfter a successful DELETE /cluster/metrocluster/dr-groups is issued, an HTTP status code of 202 (Accepted) is returned along with a job UUID and a link in the body of the response. The delete job continues asynchronously and can be monitored by using the job UUID and the /cluster/jobs API. The \"message\" field in the response of the GET /cluster/jobs/{uuid} request shows the current step in the job, and the \"state\" field shows the overall state of the job.\n<br/>\n---\n##

Enter the hostname or IP address in the destination field.\nFor example: syslog.mycompany.com, 192.168.1.1\n### Rest API\nThe 'rest_api' type allows you to define a URL where information about an observed event is sent using the REST protocol. Enter the URL in the destination field.\nThe URL must contain a valid transmission schema which can be one of the following:\n- http\n- https\nUsing the 'https' schema, you can configure a client-side certificate for mutual authentication.\nFor example: http://rest.mycompany.com, https://192.168.1.1\n### SNMP\nThe 'snmp' type describes addresses where information about an observed event is sent using SNMP traps.

When a relationship exists between two clusters, the clusters can exchange user data and configuration information, and coordinate operations. The /cluster/peers endpoint supports create, get, modify, and delete operations using GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE HTTP requests.\n## Create a cluster peer\nYou can set up a new cluster peer relationship by issuing a POST request to /cluster/peers. Parameters in the POST body define the settings of the peering relationship. A successful POST request that succeeds in creating a peer returns HTTP status code \"201\", along with the details of the created peer, such as peer UUID, name, and authentication information. A failed POST request returns an HTTP error code along with a message indicating the reason for the error. This can include malformed requests and invalid operations.\n### Sample request\n```\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/' -d '{\"authentication\":{\"expiry_time\":\"12/25/2018 12:34:56\",\"generate_passphrase\":true}}'\n```\n### Examples\n```\n# Create - no params\nbody = {}\n# Creating with a peer address and a passphrase\nbody =\n{\n    \"remote\":\n      {\n          \"ip_addresses\":[\"1.2.3.4\"]\n      }\n}\n# Creating with a peer name and a generated passphrase that is true\nbody =\n{\n    \"name\":\"cp_xyz123\",\n    \"authentication\":\n      {\n          \"generate_passphrase\":true\n      }\n}\n# Creating with a name, a peer address, and a passphrase\nbody =\n{\n    \"name\":\"cp_xyz123\",\n    \"remote\":\n      {\n          \"ip_addresses\": [\"1.2.3.4\"]\n      },\n    \"authentication\":\n      {\n          \"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\"\n      }\n }\n# Creating with a proposed encryption protocol\nbody =\n{\n    \"encryption\":\n      {\n          \"proposed\":\"tls-psk\"\n      }\n}\n```\n---\n## Create local intercluster LIFs\nThe local cluster must have an intercluster LIF on each node for the correct operation of cluster peering.\nIf no local intercluster LIFs exist, you can optionally specify LIFs to be created for each node in the local cluster.\nThese local interfaces, if specified, are created on each node before proceeding with the creation of the cluster peering relationship. Cluster peering relationships are not established if there is an error preventing the LIFs from being created.\nAfter local interfaces have been created, do not specify them for subsequent cluster peering relationships.\n### Local LIF creation fields\n* local_network.ip_addresses - List of IP addresses to assign, one per node in the local cluster.\n* local_network.netmask - IPv4 mask or subnet mask length.\n* local_network.broadcast_domain - Broadcast domain that is in use within the IPspace.\n* local_network.gateway - The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the default router.\n### Additional information on network routes\nWhen creating LIFs, the network route discovery mechanism might take additional time (1-5 seconds) to become visible in the network outside of the cluster. This delay in publishing the routes might cause an initial cluster peer \"create\" request to fail. This error disappears with a retry of the same request.\n### Example\n```\nThis example shows the POST body when creating four intercluster LIFs on a 4-node cluster before creating a cluster peer relationship.\ncluster_peer_4_node.txt:\n{\n    \"local_network\":\n    {\n        \"interfaces\": [\n            {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.4\"},\n            {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.5\"},\n            {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.6\"}\n            ],\n        \"netmask\": \"255.255.0.0\",\n        \"broadcast_domain\": \"Default\",\n        \"gateway\": \"1.2.0.1\"\n    },\n    \"remote.ip_addresses\": [\"1.2.9.9\"],\n    \"authentication.passphrase\": \"xyz12345\"\n}\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers\" -d \"@cluster_peer_4_node.txt\"\n```\nNote that \"<mgmt-ip>\" is replaced by the IP address of the cluster management interface, and the body is read from the specified text file containing the fields for the new peering relationship and local interfaces.\n---\n## Retrieve a cluster peer\nYou can retrieve peers in a cluster by issuing a GET request to /cluster/peers. It is also possible to retrieve a specific peer when qualified by its UUID to /cluster/peers/{uuid}.\nA GET request might have no query parameters or a valid cluster UUID. The former retrieves all records while the latter retrieves the record for the cluster peer with that UUID.\nThe following fields are used for retrieving a cluster peer.\n### Required fields\nThere are no required fields for GET requests.\n### Optional fields\nThe following fields are optional for GET requests\n* UUID - UUID of the cluster peer.\n### Examples\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/\"\n```\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}\"\n```\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}?fields=*\"\n```\n---\n## Update a cluster peer\nYou can update a cluster peer relationship by issuing a PATCH request to /cluster/peers/{uuid}. As in the CLI mode, you can toggle the proposed encryption protocol, update the passphrase, or specify a new set of stable addresses.  All PATCH requests take the parameters that are to be updated in the request body. If the generate_passphrase is \"true\", the passphrase is returned in the PATCH response.\nThis following fields highlight the parameters that control the modification of an existing cluster peering relationship.\n### Required fields\nA PATCH request with an empty body has no effect on the cluster peer instance. All other fields and the combinations in which they are valid are indicated below:\n* `encryption_proposed` - Toggle the proposed encryption protocol (from \"none\" to \"tls-psk\" or otherwise). Authentication must be \"true\" and a passphrase must be present in body.\n* `passphrase`\n* `passphrase` or `generate passphrase`\n* `remote.ip_addresses`\n### Optional fields\n* `expiration time` - Set the expiration time of the passphrase.\n### Examples\n```\n# Updating with an empty body\nbody = {}\n# Updating the proposed encryption protocol from tls-psk to none\nbody =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n      {\n          \"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\",\n          \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n      },\n    \"encryption\":\n      {\n          \"proposed\":\"none\"\n      }\n}\n# Updating the passphrase\nbody =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n     {\n         \"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\",\n         \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n     }\n}\n# Setting an auto-generated passphrase\nbody =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n     {\n         \"generate_passphrase\": true,\n         \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n     }\n}\n# Updating remote IP addresses\nbody =\n{\n    \"remote\":\n      {\n          \"ip_addresses\":[\"10.224.65.30\"]\n      }\n}\n```\n### Sample requests\n```\n# Setting a passphrase\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/73123071-d0b9-11e8-a686-005056a7179a' -d '{\"authentication\":{\"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\",\"in_use\":\"ok\"}}'\n# Updating a peer address\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/73123071-d0b9-11e8-a686-005056a7179a' -d '{\"remote\":{\"ip_addresses\":[\"1.2.3.4\"]}}'\n```\n---\n## Delete a cluster peer\nYou can delete a cluster peer using the HTTP DELETE request.\n### Required fields\nPerform all delete operations on a valid peer UUID. Deleting an invalid peer returns \"HTTP 404\", which indicates an error.\n### Optional fields\nThe DELETE operation has no optional fields.\n### Request format\nDELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}\"\n### Example\nThe following request deletes a peer with peer UUID \"8becc0d4-c12c-11e8-9ceb-005056bbd143\".\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/8becc0d4-c12c-11e8-9ceb-005056bbd143\"\n```\n","tags":["cluster"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/cluster_peer"},"description":"Info specification"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

It identifies an authentication type, user names, and passwords that must be used to authenticate a specific initiator.<br/>\nThe iSCSI credentials REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover iSCSI credentials.<br/>\n## How iSCSI authentication works\nAn iSCSI credentials object defines the authentication credentials to be used between an initiator and ONTAP. While establishing an iSCSI connection, the initiator sends a login request to ONTAP to begin an iSCSI session. ONTAP then either permits or denies the login request, or determines that a login is not required.<p/>\nFor an initiator, you can specify an authentication type, user names and passwords, and a whitelist of optional network addresses from which the initiator is allowed to connect.\n## iSCSI authentication methods\n  - Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) - The initiator logs in using a CHAP user name and password. There are two types of CHAP user names and passwords:\n    - Inbound - ONTAP authenticates the initiator. Inbound settings are required if you are using CHAP authentication.\n    - Outbound - These are optional credentials to enable the initiator to authenticate ONTAP. You can use credentials only if inbound credentials are also being used.\n  - deny - The initiator is denied access to ONTAP.\n  - none - ONTAP does not require authentication for the initiator.\nThe CHAP inbound/outbound password can be any valid string or an even number of valid hexidecimal digits preceded by '0X' or '0x'.\n## Initiator address list\nThe initiator address list is a way to specify valid IP addresses from which the initiator is allowed to connect. If the list is specified and the source address of an iSCSI connection is not in the list, the connection is rejected. Initiator addresses can be specified in either IPv4 or IPv6 format and in one of two forms:\n- Range\n  ```\n  {\n    \"start\": \"192.168.0.0\",\n    \"end\": \"192.168.0.255\"\n  }\n  ```\n- Mask\n  ```\n  {\n    \"address\": \"192.168.0.0\",\n    \"netmask\": \"24\"\n  }\n  ```\n## Initiator \"default\"\nThe default iSCSI authentication definition is created when the iSCSI service is created. An iSCSI credentials object with _default_ as the initiator name identifies the default authentication for an SVM. The default credentials are used for any initiator that does not have specific iSCSI credentials. The default iSCSI authentication method is _none_, but can be changed to _deny_ or _CHAP_. The default credentials object does not support an initiator address list.\n## Examples\n### Creating iSCSI credentials requiring no authentication\n```\n# The API:\nPOST

They contain file systems in a NAS environment and LUNs in a SAN environment.<br/>\nA FlexGroup volume is a scale-out NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution and scalability. A FlexGroup volume contains several constituents that automatically and transparently share the traffic.</br>\nFlexClone volumes are writable, point-in-time copies of a FlexVol volume. At this time, FlexClones of FlexGroups are not supported.<br/>\nVolumes with SnapLock type Compliance or Enterprise, are referred to as SnapLock volumes. Volumes with SnapLock type cannot be of FlexGroup style. Once a SnapLock aggregate is created, by default, volumes created inside the aggregate inherit the \"snaplock\" property from the aggregate. It is possible to create a SnapLock volume by specifying SnapLock parameters. SnapLock parameters are only available at the \"advanced\" privilege level.<br/>\nONTAP storage APIs allow you to create, modify, and monitor volumes and aggregates.<br/>\n## Storage efficiency\nStorage efficiency is used to remove duplicate blocks in the data and to compress the data. Efficiency has deduplication, compression, cross volume deduplication, and compaction options. On All Flash systems, all efficiencies are enabled by default on volume creation. Options such as \"background/inline/both\" are treated as both, which means both background and inline are enabled for any efficiency option. The option \"none\"  disables both background and inline efficiency.<br/>\nTo enable any efficiency option on all-flash or FAS systems, background deduplication is always enabled.<br/>\n## Quotas\nQuotas provide a way to restrict or track the files and space usage by a user, group, or qtree. Quotas are enabled for a specific FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume.<br/>\nThe following APIs can be used to enable or disable and obtain quota state for a FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume:\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\":\"true\"}'\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\":\"false\"}'\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{uuid}/?fields=quota.state\n## File System Analytics\nFile system analytics provide a quick method for obtaining information summarizing properties of all files within any directory tree of a volume. For more information on file system analytics, see [`DOC /storage/volumes{volume.uuid}/files/{path}`](#docs-storage-storage_volumes_{volume.uuid}_files_{path}). Analytics can be enabled or disabled on individual volumes.<br/>\nThe following APIs can be used to enable or disable and obtain analytics state for a FlexVol volume or a FlexGroup volume:\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{uuid} -d '{\"analytics.state\":\"on\"}'\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{uuid} -d '{\"analytics.state\":\"off\"}'\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{uuid}/?fields=analytics\n## QoS\nQoS policy and settings enforce Service Level Objectives (SLO) on a volume. SLO can be set by specifying qos.max_throughput_iops and/or qos.max_throughput_mbps or qos.min_throughput_iops. Specifying min_throughput_iops is only supported on volumes hosted on a node that is flash optimized. A pre-created QoS policy can also be used by specifying qos.name or qos.uuid property. <br/>\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of a volume can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` fields. These show the performance of the volume in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` fields denote an average whereas `statistics.*` fields denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes. <br/>\n## Volume APIs\nThe following APIs are used to perform operations related with FlexVol volumes and FlexGroup volumes:\n&ndash; POST      /api/storage/volumes\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/volumes\n&ndash; GET

Optionally, it can be located within a qtree in a volume.<br/>\nAn NVMe namespace is created to a specified size using thin or thick provisioning as determined by the volume on which it is created. NVMe namespaces support being cloned. An NVMe namespace cannot be renamed, resized, or moved to a different volume. NVMe namespaces do not support the assignment of a QoS policy for performance management, but a QoS policy can be assigned to the volume containing the namespace. See the NVMe namespace object model to learn more about each of the properties supported by the NVMe namespace REST API.<br/>\nAn NVMe namespace must be mapped to an NVMe subsystem to grant access to the subsystem's hosts. Hosts can then access the NVMe namespace and perform I/O using the NVMe over Fabrics protocol.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of an NVMe namespace can be monitored by observing the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These properties show the performance of an NVMe namespace in terms of IOPS, latency, and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average, whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Creating an NVMe namespace\nThis example creates a 300 gigabyte NVMe namespace, with 4096-byte blocks, in SVM _svm1_, volume _vol1_, configured for use by _linux_ hosts. The `return_records` query parameter is used to retrieve properties of the newly created NVMe namespace in the POST response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/namespaces\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces?return_records=true' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" }, \"os_type\": \"linux\", \"space\": { \"block_size\": \"4096\", \"size\": \"300G\" }, \"name\" : \"/vol/vol1/namespace1\" }'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"dccdc3e6-cf4e-498f-bec6-f7897f945669\",\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"6bf967fd-2a1c-11e9-b682-005056bbc17d\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/6bf967fd-2a1c-11e9-b682-005056bbc17d\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace1\",\n      \"location\": {\n        \"namespace\": \"namespace1\",\n        \"volume\": {\n          \"uuid\": \"71cd0dba-2a1c-11e9-b682-005056bbc17d\",\n          \"name\": \"vol1\",\n          \"_links\": {\n            \"self\": {\n              \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes/71cd0dba-2a1c-11e9-b682-005056bbc17d\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"os_type\": \"linux\",\n      \"space\": {\n        \"block_size\": 4096,\n        \"size\": 322122547200,\n        \"used\": 0,\n        \"guarantee\": {\n          \"requested\": false,\n          \"reserved\": false\n        }\n      },\n      \"status\": {\n        \"container_state\": \"online\",\n        \"read_only\": false,\n        \"state\": \"online\"\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/namespaces/dccdc3e6-cf4e-498f-bec6-f7897f945669\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Updating an NVMe namespace\nThis example sets the `comment` property of an NVMe namespace.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/namespaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces/dccdc3e6-cf4e-498f-bec6-f7897f945669' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"comment\": \"Data for the research department.\" }'\n```\n---\n### Retrieving NVMe namespaces\nThis example retrieves summary information for all online NVMe namespaces in SVM _svm1_.

As blocks of the source and clone are modified, unique blocks are written for each. NVMe namespace clones can be created quickly and consume very little space initially. They can be created for the purpose of back-up, or to replicate data for multiple consumers.<br/>\nAn NVMe namespace clone can also be set to auto-delete by setting the `auto_delete` property. If the namespace's volume is configured for automatic deletion, NVMe namespaces that have auto-delete enabled are deleted when a volume is nearly full to reclaim a target amount of free space in the volume.\n### Creating a new NVMe namespace clone\nYou create an NVMe namespace clone as you create any NVMe namespace -- a POST to [`/storage/namespaces`](#/NVMe/nvme_namespace_create). Set `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` to identify the source NVMe namespace from which the clone is created. The NVMe namespace clone and its source must reside in the same volume.\n<br/>\nThe source NVMe namespace can reside in a Snapshot copy, in which case, the `clone.source.name` field must be used to identify it. Add `/.snapshot/<snapshot_name>` to the path after the volume name to identify the Snapshot copy. For example `/vol/vol1/.snapshot/snap1/namespace1`.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/namespaces\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" }, \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace2clone1\", \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace2\" } } }'\n```\n---\n### Over-writing an existing NVMe namespace's data as a clone of another\nYou can over-write an existing NVMe namespace as a clone of another. You do this as a PATCH on the NVMe namespace to overwrite -- a PATCH to [`/storage/namespaces/{uuid}`](#/NVMe/nvme_namespace_modify). Set the `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` property to identify the source NVMe namespace from which the clone data is taken. The NVMe namespace clone and its source must reside in the same volume.<br/>\nWhen used in a PATCH, the patched NVMe namespace's data is over-written as a clone of the source and the following properties are preserved from the patched namespace unless otherwise specified as part of the PATCH: `auto_delete`, `subsystem_map`, `status.state`, and `uuid`.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/namespaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces/dccdc3e6-cf4e-498f-bec6-f7897f945669' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace2\" } } }'\n```\n---\n## Deleting an NVMe namespace\n```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/storage/namespaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces/5c254d22-96a6-42ac-aad8-0cd9ebd126b6' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n```\n---\n","tags":["NVMe"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"required":"1","in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/nvme_namespace"},"description":"The property values for the new NVMe namespace.\n"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

SLO can be set by specifying \"qos_policy.max_throughput_iops\" and/or \"qos_policy.max_throughput_mbps\" or \"qos_policy.min_throughput_iops\".\nSpecifying \"min_throughput_iops\" is only supported on volumes hosted on a node that is flash optimized. A pre-created QoS policy can also be used by specifying \"qos_policy.name\" or \"qos_policy.uuid\" properties.\nSetting or assigning a QoS policy to a qtree is not supported if its containing volume or SVM already has a QoS policy attached, or a file or LUN in its containing volume already has a QoS policy attached.\n<br/>\n## Qtree APIs\nThe following APIs are used to create, retrieve, modify, and delete qtrees.\n&ndash; POST      /api/storage/qtrees\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/qtrees\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/qtrees/{volume-uuid}/{qtree-id}\n&ndash; PATCH     /api/storage/qtrees/{volume-uuid}/{qtree-id}\n&ndash; DELETE    /api/storage/qtrees/{volume-uuid}/{qtree-id}\n## Examples\n### Creating a qtree inside a volume for an SVM\nThis API is used to create a qtree inside a volume for an SVM.<br/>\nThe following example shows how to create a qtree in a FlexVol volume with a given security style, user, group, UNIX permissions, an export policy, and a QoS policy.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/qtrees\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/qtrees?return_records=true' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d @test_qtree_post.txt\ntest_qtree_post.txt(body):\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n    \"name\": \"svm1\"\n  },\n  \"volume\": {\n    \"name\": \"fv\"\n  },\n  \"name\": \"qt1\",\n  \"security_style\": \"unix\",\n  \"user\": {\n    \"name\": \"unix_user1\"\n  },\n  \"group\": {\n    \"name\": \"unix_group1\"\n  },\n  \"unix_permissions\": 744,\n  \"export_policy\": {\n      \"name\": \"default\"\n  },\n  \"qos_policy\": {\n      \"max_throughput_iops\": 1000\n  }\n}\n# The response:\n{\n    \"num_records\": 1,\n    \"records\": [\n      {\n        \"svm\": {\n          \"name\": \"svm1\"\n        },\n        \"volume\": {\n          \"name\": \"fv\"\n        },\n        \"name\": \"qt1\",\n        \"security_style\": \"unix\",\n        \"user\": {\n          \"name\": \"unix_user1\"\n        },\n        \"group\": {\n          \"name\": \"unix_group1\"\n        },\n        \"unix_permissions\": 744,\n        \"export_policy\": {\n          \"name\": \"default\"\n        },\n        \"qos_policy\": {\n          \"min_throughput_iops\": 0,\n          \"max_throughput_iops\": 1000,\n          \"max_throughput_mbps\": 0,\n          \"uuid\": \"39ac471f-ff35-11e9-b0f9-005056a7ab52\",\n          \"name\": \"vs0_auto_gen_policy_39a9522f_ff35_11e9_b0f9_005056a7ab52\"\n        },\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/storage/qtrees/?volume.name=fv&name=qt1\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"job\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"84edef3c-4f6d-11e9-9a71-005056a7f717\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/84edef3c-4f6d-11e9-9a71-005056a7f717\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving qtrees\nThis API is used to retrieve qtrees. <br/>\nThe following example shows how to retrieve qtrees belonging to SVM _svm1_ and volume _fv_.

For example, WAFL uses the key management framework to store and retrieve the volume encryption keys that it uses to encrypt/decrypt data on NVE volumes. A key manager can be configured at both cluster scope and SVM, with one key manager allowed per SVM. The key management framework in ONTAP supports two mutually exclusive modes for persisting keys: external and onboard.<p/>\nWhen an SVM is configured with external key management, the keys are stored on up to four key servers that are external to the system.<p/>\nOnce external key management is enabled for an SVM, key servers can be added or removed using the <i>/api/security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers</i> endpoint. See [`POST /security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers`] and [`DELETE /security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers/{server}`] for more details.<p/>\nSetting up external key management dictates that the required certificates for securely communicating with the key server are installed prior to configuring the key manager. To install the required client and server_ca certificates, use the <i>/api/security/certificates/</i> endpoint. <p/>\nSee [`POST /security/certificates`], [`GET /security/certificates/uuid`] and [`DELETE /security/certificates/{uuid}`] for more details.<p/>\nWhen an SVM is configured with the Onboard Key Manager, the keys are stored in ONTAP in wrapped format using a key hierarchy created using the salted hash of the passphrase entered when configuring the Onboard Key Manager. This model fits well for customers who use ONTAP to store their own data. <p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating an external key manager with 1 key server for a cluster\nThe example key manager is configured at the cluster-scope with one key server. Note that the UUIDs of the certificates are those that are already installed at the cluster-scope. Note the <i>return_records=true</i> query parameter is used to obtain the newly created key manager configuration<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/security/key-managers\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/key-managers?return_records=true' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d \"{ \\\"external\\\": { \\\"client_certificate\\\": { \\\"uuid\\\": \\\"5fb1701a-d922-11e8-bfe8-005056bb017d\\\" }, \\\"server_ca_certificates\\\": [ { \\\"uuid\\\": \\\"827d7d31-d6c8-11e8-b5bf-005056bb017d\\\" }],\\\"servers\\\": [ { \\\"server\\\": \\\"10.225.89.33:5696\\\" } ] } }\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"815e9462-dc57-11e8-9b2c-005056bb017d\",\n      \"external\": {\n        \"client_certificate\": {\n          \"uuid\": \"5fb1701a-d922-11e8-bfe8-005056bb017d\"\n        },\n        \"server_ca_certificates\": [\n          {\n            \"uuid\": \"827d7d31-d6c8-11e8-b5bf-005056bb017d\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"servers\": [\n          {\n            \"server\": \"10.225.89.33:5696\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/security/key-managers/815e9462-dc57-11e8-9b2c-005056bb017d\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Creating an external key manager with 1 primary key server and 2 secondary key servers for a cluster\nThe example key manager is configured at the cluster-scope with one key server and two secondary key servers.

All nodes must be running the same version of ONTAP to use this API. Mixed version joins are not supported in this release. You can provide properties as fields in the body of the POST request to configure node-specific settings. On a successful request, POST /cluster/nodes returns a status code of 202 and job information in the body of the request. You can use the /cluster/jobs APIs to track the status of the node add job.\n### Fields used for adding a node\nFields used for the /cluster/nodes APIs fall into the following categories:\n* Required node fields\n* Optional fields\n* Network interface fields\n* Records field\n### Required node fields\nThe following field is required for any POST /cluster/nodes request:\n* cluster_interface.ip.address\n### Optional fields\nAll of the following fields are used to set up additional cluster-wide configurations:\n* name\n* location\n* records\n### Network interface fields\nYou can set a node-specific configuration for each node by using the POST /cluster/nodes API. If you provide a field in the body of a node, provide it for all nodes in the POST body.\nYou can provide the node management interface for each node if all node management interfaces in the cluster use the same subnet mask. If the node management interfaces use different subnet masks, use the /network/ip/interfaces API to configure the node management interfaces.\n### The records field\nTo add multiple nodes to the cluster in one request, provide an array named \"records\" with multiple node entries. Each node entry in \"records\" must follow the required and optional fields listed previously. When only adding a single node, you do not need a \"records\" field. See \"Examples\" for an example of how to use the \"records\" field.\n### Create recommended aggregates parameter\nWhen you set the \"create_recommended_aggregates\" parameter to \"true\", aggregates based on an optimal layout recommended by the system are created on each of the nodes being added to the cluster. The default setting is \"false\".\n<br/>\n---\n## Modifying node configurations\nThe following fields can be used to modify a node configuration:\n* name\n* location\n<br/>\n---\n## Modifying service processor configurations\nWhen modifying the \"service_processor\" properties, the job returns success immediately if valid network information is passed in. The values remain in their old state until the network information changes have taken effect on the service processor. You can poll the modified properties until the values are updated.\n<br/>\n---\n## Deleting a node from a cluster\nYou can delete a node from the cluster. Before deleting a node from the cluster, shut down all of the node's shared resources, such as virtual interfaces to clients. If any of the node's shared resources are still active, the command fails.\nYou can use the \"force\" flag to forcibly remove a node that is down and cannot be brought online to remove its shared resources. This flag is set to \"false\" by default.\n<br/>\n---\n## Node state\nThe node \"state\" field in the /cluster/nodes API represents the current operational state of individual nodes.\nNote that the state of a node is a transient value and can change depending on the current condition of the node, especially during reboot, takeover, and giveback.\nPossible values for the node state are:\n* <i>up</i> - Node is fully operational and is able to accept and handle management requests. It is connected to a majority of healthy (up) nodes in the cluster through the cluster interconnect and all critical services are online.\n* <i>booting</i> - Node is starting up and is not yet fully functional. It might not yet be accessible through the management interface or cluster interconnect. One or more critical services are offline on the node and the node is not taken over. The HA partner reports the node's firmware state as \"SF_BOOTING\", \"SF_BOOTED\", or \"SF_CLUSTERWAIT\".\n* <i>down</i> - Node is known to be down.  It cannot be reached through the management interface or cluster interconnect. The HA partner can be reached and reports that the node is halted/rebooted without takeover. Or, the HA partner cannot be reached (or no SFO configured) but the node shutdown request has been recorded by the quorum change coordinator. The state is reported by the node's HA partner.\n* <i>taken_over</i> - Node is taken over by its HA partner. The state is reported by the node's HA partner.\n* <i>waiting_for_giveback</i> - Node is taken over by its HA partner and is now ready and waiting for giveback. To bring the node up, either issue the \"giveback\" command to the HA partner node or wait for auto-giveback, if enabled. The state is reported by the node's HA partner.\n* <i>degraded</i> - Node is known to be up but is not yet fully functional. The node can be reached through the cluster interconnect but one or more critical services are offline. Or, the node is not reachable but the node's HA partner can be reached and reports that the node is up with firmware state \"SF_UP\".\n* <i>unknown</i> - Node state cannot be determined.\n<br/>\n---\n## HA\nThe \"ha\" field in the /cluster/nodes API shows the takeover and giveback states of the node along with the current values of the HA fields \"enabled\"and \"auto_giveback\".\nYou can modify the HA fields \"enabled\" and \"auto_giveback\", which will change the HA states of the node.\n### Takeover\nThe takeover \"state\" field shows the different takeover states of the node. When the state is \"failed\", the \"code\" and \"message\" fields display.\nPossible values for takeover states are:\n* <i>not_attempted</i> - Takeover operation is not started and takeover is possible.\n* <i>not_possible</i> - Takeover operation is not possible. Check the failure message.\n* <i>in_progress</i> - Takeover operation is in progress. The node is taking over its partner.\n* <i>in_takeover</i> - Takeover operation is complete.\n* <i>failed</i> - Takeover operation failed. Check the failure message.\n###\nPossible values for takeover failure code and messages are:\n* <i>code</i>: 852130\n  <i>message</i>: Failed to initiate takeover. Run the \\\"storage failover show-takeover\\\" command for more information.\n* <i>code</i>: 852131\n  <i>message</i>: Takeover cannot be completed. Reason: disabled.\n### Giveback\nThe giveback \"state\" field shows the different giveback states of the node. When the state is \"failed\", the \"code\" and \"message\" fields display.\nPossible values for giveback states are:\n* <i>nothing_to_giveback</i> - Node does not have partner aggregates to giveback.\n* <i>not_attempted</i> - Giveback operation is not started.\n* <i>in_progress</i> - Giveback operation is in progress.\n* <i>failed</i> - Giveback operation failed. Check the failure message.\n###\nPossible values for giveback failure codes and messages are:\n* <i>code</i>: 852126\n  <i>message</i>: Failed to initiate giveback. Run the \\\"storage failover show-giveback\\\" command for more information.\n<br/>\n---\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of a node can be monitored by observing the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These properties show the performance of a node in terms of cpu utilization. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properies denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n<br/>\n---\n## Examples\nThe following examples show how to add nodes to a cluster, update node properties, shutdown and reboot a node, and remove a node from the cluster.\n### Adding a single node with a minimal configuration\n```\n# Body\nadd_single_node.txt(body):\n{\n  \"cluster_interface\": {\n    \"ip\": {\n      \"address\": \"1.1.1.1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes\" -d \"@add_single_node.txt\"\n```\n---\n### Adding multiple nodes in the same request and creating recommended aggregates\n```\n# Body\nadd_multiple_nodes.txt(body):\n{\n  \"records\": [\n      {\n          \"name\": \"node1\",\n          \"cluster_interface\": {\n            \"ip\": {\n              \"address\": \"1.1.1.1\"\n            }\n          }\n      },\n      {\n          \"name\": \"node2\",\n          \"cluster_interface\": {\n            \"ip\": {\n              \"address\": \"2.2.2.2\"\n            }\n          }\n      }\n  ]\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes?create_recommended_aggregates=true\" -d \"@add_multiple_nodes.txt\"\n```\n---\n### Modifying a cluster-wide configuration\n```\n# Body\nmodify_name_and_location.txt(body):\n{\n  \"name\": \"renamedNode\",\n  \"location\": \"newLocation\"\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes\" -d \"@modify_name_and_location.txt\"\n```\n---\n### Shutting down a node\n```\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes/{uuid}?action=shutdown\"\n```\n---\n### Deleting a node from a cluster\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes/{uuid}\"\n```\n### Force a node deletion from a cluster\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes/{uuid}?force=true\"\n```\n---\n### Retrieving the state of all nodes in a cluster\n```\n#Request\ncurl -siku admin -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes?fields=state\"\n#Response\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"54440ec3-6127-11e9-a959-005056bb76f9\",\n      \"name\": \"node2\",\n      \"state\": \"up\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes/54440ec3-6127-11e9-a959-005056bb76f9\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"e02dbef1-6126-11e9-b8fb-005056bb9ce4\",\n      \"name\": \"node1\",\n      \"state\": \"up\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes/e02dbef1-6126-11e9-b8fb-005056bb9ce4\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes?fields=state\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving statistics and metric for a node\nIn this example, the API returns the \"statistics\" and \"metric\" properties.\n```\n#Request\ncurl -siku admin -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes?fields=statistics,metric\"\n#Response\n{\n      \"records\": [\n      {\n        \"uuid\": \"6b29327b-21ca-11ea-99aa-005056bb420b\",\n        \"name\": \"prij-vsim1\",\n        \"metric\": {\n          \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-19T15:50:45Z\",\n          \"duration\": \"PT15S\",\n          \"status\": \"ok\",\n          \"processor_utilization\": 3\n        },\n        \"statistics\": {\n          \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-19T15:50:48Z\",\n          \"status\": \"ok\",\n          \"processor_utilization_raw\": 6409411622,\n          \"processor_utilization_base\": 74330229886\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"num_records\": 1\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving takeover and giveback failure codes and messages\n```\n#Request\ncurl -siku admin -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes?fields=ha\"\n#Response\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"54440ec3-6127-11e9-a959-005056bb76f9\",\n      \"name\": \"node2\",\n      \"ha\": {\n        \"enabled\": false,\n        \"auto_giveback\": false,\n        \"partners\": [\n          {\n            \"uuid\": \"e02dbef1-6126-11e9-b8fb-005056bb9ce4\",\n            \"name\": \"node1\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"giveback\": {\n              \"state\": \"nothing_to_giveback\"\n        },\n        \"takeover\": {\n          \"state\": \"not_possible\",\n          \"failure\": {\n            \"message\": \"Takeover cannot be completed.

A filter is a named collection of rules that enable the system to identify events that require additional handling. A filter is linked with a destination to which the system sends specific events.</br>\nWhen EMS processes an event, each filter is evaluated for a match. More than one filter can handle a single event.\n### Filter rule position\nA filter's rules are evaluated sequentially, according to their position index. When a rule is added or modified, the position can be set to customize the filter's logic. If no position is specified, a new rule is appended to the end of the list.\n### Filter rule types\nA filter rule can be one of two types: 'include' or 'exclude'.\nIf an event matches the criteria of the rule, the type dictates whether it should be forwarded to the destination or ignored.\n### Filter rule matching criteria\nA valid filter rule must contain at least one set of criteria.\n#### Name pattern\nA name pattern is matched against an event's name. Multiple characters can be matched using the wildcard character '*'.\n#### Severity\nThe severity pattern is matched against an event's severity. Multiple severities can be specified in a comma separated list. A single wildcard '*' will match all severities. Valid values are:\n- emergency\n- alert\n- error\n- notice\n- informational\n- debug\n#### SNMP trap type\nThe SNMP trap type pattern is matched against an event's trap type. Multiple trap types can be specified in a comma separated list. A single wildcard '*' matches all trap types. Valid values are:\n- standard\n- built_in\n- severity_based\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of filters whose names contain a hyphen\n```JSON\n# API\nGET /api/support/ems/filters?name=*-*\n# Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"default-trap-events\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/ems/filters/default-trap-events\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"important-events\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/ems/filters/important-events\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"no-info-debug-events\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/ems/filters/no-info-debug-events\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 3,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/support/ems/filters?name=*-*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Creating a new filter using various matching criteria\n```JSON\n# API\nPOST /api/support/ems/filters\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"name\": \"test-filter\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"include\",\n      \"message_criteria\": {\n        \"name_pattern\": \"LUN.*\",\n        \"severities\": \"alert,error\",\n        \"snmp_trap_types\": \"severity_based\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n# Response\n201 Created\n```\n","tags":["support"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ems_filter"},"description":"Information specification"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

A 'cluster' backup contains cluster-wide configuration in addition to the configuration of each node in the cluster. A 'node' backup contains only node-specific configuration such as configuration files on the root volume and the boot variables. For creating a cluster backup, a cluster-wide job is queued. For creating a node backup, a private job local to the node is queued.\nIn addition to the backups created using this API, ONTAP creates configuration backups automatically based on job schedules. This API supports creating configuration backups on demand only. It supports deleting and retrieving configuration backups that are created automatically or on demand.\nFor information on configuration backup settings for automatically created backups, see [`DOC /support/configuration-backup`](#docs-support-support_configuration-backup)\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of configuration backup files\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/support/configuration-backup/backups\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/configuration-backup/backups\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"node\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"5cafe0f6-499f-11e9-b644-005056bbcf93\",\n        \"name\": \"node1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes/5cafe0f6-499f-11e9-b644-005056bbcf93\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"backup1.7z\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/5cafe0f6-499f-11e9-b644-005056bbcf93/backup1.7z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/support/configuration-backup/backups\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving details of the specified configuration backup file\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/{node.uuid}/{name}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/bc2f15d0-8b93-11e9-90e9-005056bb6a30/backup1.7z\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"node\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"bc2f15d0-8b93-11e9-90e9-005056bb6a30\",\n    \"name\": \"node1\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes/bc2f15d0-8b93-11e9-90e9-005056bb6a30\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"name\": \"backup1.7z\",\n  \"type\": \"cluster\",\n  \"time\": \"2019-06-10T13:35:06-04:00\",\n  \"size\": 6058408,\n  \"backup_nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"node1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"node2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"version\": \"9.7.0\",\n  \"auto\": false,\n  \"download_link\": \"https://10.224.66.113/backups/backup1.7z\",\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/bc2f15d0-8b93-11e9-90e9-005056bb6a30/backup1.7z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Creating a configuration backup file\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/support/configuration-backup/backups\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/configuration-backup/backups\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d \"@create_backup.txt\"\ncreate_backup.txt:\n{\n  \"node\":\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"ac13c636-4fc9-11e9-94c2-005056bb2516\",\n      \"name\": \"node1\"\n    },\n  \"name\": \"backup3.7z\"\n}\n# The response header:\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nDate: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:26:24 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nLocation: /api/support/configuration-backup/backups/ac13c636-4fc9-11e9-94c2-005056bb2516/backup3.7z\nContent-Length: 189\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"22acfb68-4fd3-11e9-94c2-005056bb2516\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/22acfb68-4fd3-11e9-94c2-005056bb2516\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Deleting a configuration backup file\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/{node.uuid}/{name}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/configuration-backup/backups/5cafe0f6-499f-11e9-b644-005056bbcf93/backup1.7z\" -H \"content-type: application/json\"\n# The response header:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:32:23 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 3\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n```\n---\n","tags":["support"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"required":"1","in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/configuration_backup_file"},"description":"Details of the configuration backup to be created."},{"minimum":"0","maximum":"120","name":"return_timeout","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","default":"0","description":"The number of seconds to allow the call to execute before returning.

Before you begin, the following prerequisites must be in place:</br>\n * At least one SVM LIF must exist on the SVM.\n * The LIFs must be able to connect to the DNS servers configured on the SVM and to an Active Directory domain controller of the domain to which you want to join the CIFS server.\n * The DNS servers must contain the service location records that are needed to locate the Active Directory domain services.\n * The cluster time must be synchronized to within five minutes of the Active Directory domain controller.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of the SVM can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These show the performance of the SVM in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n### Information on the CIFS server\n You must keep the following in mind when creating the CIFS server:\n * The CIFS server name might or might not be the same as the SVM name.\n * The CIFS server name can be up to 15 characters in length.\n * The following characters are not allowed: @ # * ( ) = + [ ] | ; : \" , < > \\ / ?\n * You must use the FQDN when specifying the domain.\n * The default is to add the CIFS server machine account to the Active Directory \"CN=Computer\" object.\n * You can choose to add the CIFS server to a different organizational unit (OU) by specifying the \"organizational_unit\" parameter. When specifying the OU, do not specify the domain portion of the distinguished name; only specify the OU or CN portion of the distinguished name. ONTAP appends the value provided for the required \"-domain\" parameter onto the value provided for the \"-ou\" parameter to create the Active Directory distinguished name, which is used when joining the Active Directory domain.\n * You can optionally choose to add a text comment of up to 48 characters about the CIFS server. If there is a space in the comment text, you must enclose the entire string in quotation marks.\n * You can optionally choose to add a comma-delimited list of one or more NetBIOS aliases for the CIFS server.\n * The initial administrative status of the CIFS server is \"up\".\n * The <i> large-mtu</i> and <i>multichannel</i> features are enabled for the new CIFS server.\n * If LDAP is configured with the <i>use_start_tls</i> and <i>session_security</i> features, the new CIFS server will also have this property set.\n## Examples\n### Creating a CIFS server\nTo create a CIFS server, use the following API.

A privilege defines the access level of the API as either \"none\", \"readonly\", or \"all\". This specifies whether the user account can perform only a GET operation or POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations as well. A role can comprise of multiple tuples and each tuple consists of the REST API and its access level.\nFor example, \"role1\" might be a role that has a tuple {\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/storage/volume\"}, which means that a user account with \"role1\" can perform all GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests on the <i>api/storage/volume</i> API or derived APIs which have <i>api/storage/volume</i> as the prefix.<p/>\nIn cases where a role has tuples with multiple APIs having the same prefix, the highest match wins out.\nFor example, if \"role1\" has the following tuples: {\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster\"} and {\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster/schedules\"}, then only a GET request is allowed on APIs with <i>api/cluster</i> as the prefix; while POST, PATCH and DELETE requests are possible on the <i>api/cluster/schedules</i> API.\n### Predefined (built-in) roles\nRelated REST APIs are used to form predefined cluster-scoped and SVM-scoped roles, such as: \"admin\", \"backup\", \"readonly\" for cluster and \"vsadmin\", \"vsadmin-backup\", \"vsadmin-protocol\" for SVMs.\nThese can be retrieved by calling a GET request on <i>/api/security/roles</i> API and can be assigned to user accounts. See the examples for <i>api/security/accounts</i>.<br/>\nThese predefined roles cannot be modified or deleted.\n### Mapped roles\nBefore REST APIs, the RBAC roles (legacy roles) were defined to contain the CLI commands and their access levels. Now, almost all REST APIs map to one or more CLI commands. When a role is created using a POST request on <i>/api/security/roles</i>, a mapped legacy role is created. This legacy role has the same access level (as that of the REST API) for the mapped CLI commands. However, if a legacy role with the same name already exists, the POST operation fails and you need to choose a unique name for the role. The legacy roles cannot be managed using the REST endpoint <i>/api/security/roles</i> or its derivatives. Legacy roles are managed using the CLI commands \"security login role <create | modify | delete> -role <rolename>\".<p/>\nNote that the mapped legacy role (for the REST API role created) cannot be manipulated using the CLI.<br/>\nThe reverse case is not true; the creation of a legacy role will not create a mapped role with equivalent REST APIs.<p/>\n### API restrictions\nNumerous APIs are scoped for the cluster level only. This results in an access error if assigned to an SVM-scoped role. For example, <i>api/cluster/nodes</i> does not work when added as a tuple entry for an SVM-scoped role.<p/>\nA number of APIs allowed for an SVM-scoped role might have restrictions on the access level. For example, <i>/api/network/ethernet/ports</i> cannot have an access level of \"all\" for an SVM-scoped role; this results in an access error when a POST or PATCH request is made.<p/>\nRoles created with a REST API path prefix which is common to many APIs might have restrictions based on the scope of the role; cluster or SVM.\nFor example, {\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/security\"} might be a tuple entry for an SVM role. Any GET, POST, PATCH, or DELETE operation fails on API <i>/api/security/accounts</i> while the same on <i>/api/security/login/messages</i> succeeds. However, a role with exactly the same tuple when created at the cluster-scope level allows the operations.<p/>\nNumerous APIs have restrictions on the objects that can be operated on based on the context of the SVM or cluster. For example, a POST request on <i>/api/security/authentication/password</i> API changes the password for a user account. If executed in the context of an SVM (POST request on an SVM interface), only the password of the user executing the POST can be modified, and attempts to modify the password of any other user results in an access error. However, if a POST request is performed by a cluster administrator account, the password for any user account (cluster or SVM) can be modified.<p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating a cluster-scoped custom role\nSpecify the role name and the tuples (of REST APIs and their access level) in the body of the POST request. The owner.uuid or owner.name are not required to be specified for a cluster-scoped role.<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/roles\"\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/roles\" -d '{\"name\":\"cluster_role\", \"privileges\" : [{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster/jobs\"},{\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/application/applications\"},{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/application/templates\"}]}'\n```\n### Creating an SVM-scoped custom role\nFor an SVM-scoped role, specify either owner.name or owner.uuid in the request body along with other parameters for the role. These correspond to the name or UUID of the SVM for which the role is being created and can be obtained from the response body of the GET request performed on the <i>/api/svm/svms</i> API.<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/roles\"\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/roles\" -d '{\"owner\": {\"uuid\" : \"9f93e553-4b02-11e9-a3f9-005056bb7acd\"},\"name\":\"svm_role\", \"privileges\" : [{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster/jobs\"},{\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/application/applications\"},{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/application/templates\"}]}'\n```\n###

These properties are all inexpensive to retrieve and their meaning is consistent for every type of application.\n* `statistics.*` - application statistics report live usage data about the application and its components. Various space and IOPS details are included at both the application level and at a per component level. The application model includes a detailed description of each property. These properties are slightly more expensive than the generic properties because live data must be collected from every storage element in the application.\n* `<template>` - the property corresponding to the value of the `template.name` returns the contents of the application in the same layout that was used to provision the application. This information is very expensive to retrieve because it requires collecting information about all the storage and access settings for every element of the application. There are a few notable limitations to what can be returned in the `<template>` section:\n  * The `new_igroups` array of many SAN templates is not returned by GET. This property allows igroup creation in the same call that creates an application, but is not a property of the application itself. The `new_igroups` array is allowed during PATCH operations, but that does not modify the `new_igroups` of the application. It is another way to allow igroup creation while updating the application to use a different igroup.\n  * The `vdi_on_san` and `vdi_on_nas` `desktops.count` property is rounded to the nearest 1000 during creation, and is reported with that rounding applied.\n  * The `mongo_db_on_san` `dataset.element_count` property is rounded up to an even number, and is reported with that rounding applied.\n  * The `sql_on_san` and `sql_on_smb` `server_cores_count` property is limited to 8 for GET operations. Higher values are accepted by POST, but the impact of the `server_cores_count` property on the application layout currently reaches its limit at 8.\n### Learn more\n* [`DOC /application`](#docs-application-overview)\n","tags":["application"]},"delete":{"parameters":[{"required":"1","in":"path","name":"uuid","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"string","description":"Application UUID"},{"required":"","in":"query","name":"delete_data","x-ntap-introduced":"9.8","type":"boolean","default":"1","description":"By default, deleting an application deletes all of the application's data.

The `storage_service`, `size`, and `igroup_name` of an application may be modified.\n### `storage_service`\nStorage service modifications are processed in place, meaning that the storage can not be moved to a location with more performance headroom to accommodate the request. If the current backing storage of the application is in a location that can support increased performance, the QoS policies associated with the application will be modified to allow it. If not, an error will be returned. A storage service modification to a lower tier of performance is always allowed, but the reverse modification may not be supported if the cluster is over provisioned and the cluster is unlikely to be able to fulfil the original storage service.\n### `size`\nSize modifications are processed in a variety of ways depending on the type of application. For NAS applications, volumes are grown or new volumes are added. For SAN applications, LUNs are grown, new LUNs are added to existing volumes, or new LUNs are added to new volumes. If new storage elements are created, they can be found using the [`GET /application/applications/{application.uuid}/components`](#operations-application-application_component_collection_get) interface. The creation time of each storage object is included, and the newly created objects will use the same naming scheme as the previous objects. Resize follows the best practices associated with the type of application being expanded. Reducing the size of an application is not supported.\n### `igroup_name`\nModification of the igroup name allows an entire application to be mapped from one initiator group to another. Data access will be interrupted as the LUNs are unmapped from the original igroup and remapped to the new one.\n### Application state\nDuring a modification, the `state` property of the application updates to indicate `modifying`. In `modifying` state, statistics are not available and Snapshot copy operations are not allowed. If the modification fails, it is possible for the application to be left in an inconsistent state, with the underlying ONTAP storage elements not matching across a component. When this occurs, the application is left in the `modifying` state until the command is either retried and succeeds or a call to restore the original state is successful.\n### Examples\n1. Change the storage service of the database of the Oracle application to _extreme_ and resize the redo logs to _100GB_.\n    ```\n    {\n      \"oracle_on_nfs\": {\n        \"db\": {\n          \"storage_service\": {\n            \"name\": \"extreme\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"redo_log\": {\n          \"size\": \"100GB\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n2. Change the storage service, size, and igroup of a generic application by component name.\n    ```\n    {\n      \"san\": {\n        \"application_components\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"component1\",\n            \"storage_service\": {\n              \"name\": \"value\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"component2\",\n            \"size\": \"200GB\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"component3\",\n            \"igroup_name\": \"igroup5\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n### Learn more\n* [`DOC /application`](#docs-application-overview)\n* [`Asynchronous operations`](#Synchronous_and_asynchronous_operations)\n","tags":["application"]}},"/support/ems/events":{"x-ntap-long-description":{"description":"## Overview\nQueries a live collection of observed events on the system.\nNote: The `filter.name` parameter is used to pass a filter to be applied to the event collection returned.

for the specified aggregate.\nThe collection GET operation retrieves read, write, other and total metrics for a given aggregate, in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The read and write categories display the I/O operations that service user reads and writes across all the hosted volumes on a given aggregate. The other category encompasses background I/O operations that implement data protection services currently running on the aggregate. IOPs are the number of I/O operations reported per second, throughput is the amount of I/O operations measured in bytes per second and latency is the average response time for an IOP, reported in microseconds.\nWithout a specified time interval, the output is limited to statistics collected at 15 second intervals over the last hour.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving metrics for an aggregate\nIn this example, the API returns a set of records that exist for the aggregate with the given UUID for the last hour.\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates/{uuid}/metrics\n#The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/aggregates/538bf337-1b2c-11e8-bad0-005056b48388/metrics?max_records=4\" -H \"accept: application/json\"\n#The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-14T23:33:45Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-14T23:33:30Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-14T23:33:15Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-14T23:33:00Z\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 4\n}\n```\n### Retrieving metrics for an aggregate with a set timestamp\nIn this example, the API returns metric values for latency, IOPS, and throughput properties such as read, write and total.

An FC interface provides FC access to storage within the interface SVM using either Fibre Channel Protocol or NVMe over FC (NVMe/FC).<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel interface REST API allows you to create, delete, update, and discover FC interfaces, and obtain status information for FC interfaces.<br/>\nAn FC interface is created on an FC port which is located on a cluster node. The FC port must be specified to identify the location of the interface for a POST or PATCH request that relocates an interface. You can identify the port by supplying either the node and port names or the port UUID.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of an FC interface can be monitored by observing the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These properties show the performance of an FC interface in terms of IOPS, latency, and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average, whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Creating an FC interface

deleting an FC interface, the interface must first be disabled using the following:\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"enabled\": false }'\n```\n---\n### Moving an FC interface to a new node and port\nTo move an FC interface to another node or port, the destination FC port must be specified in a PATCH request. Either the port UUID or node and port names can be used to identify the port.<br/>\nNote that only FC interfaces configured for the FC Protocol can be moved. FC interfaces configured for NVMe/FC cannot be moved. The interface must also be set to the disabled state before being moved.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"location\": { \"home_port\": { \"uuid\": \"a1dc7aa5-db83-11e8-9ef7-005056bbbbcc\" } } }'\n```\n---\n### Deleting an FC interface\nThe FC interface must be disabled before being deleted.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n```\n","tags":["networking"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"required":"1","in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/fc_interface"},"description":"The property values for the new FC interface.\n"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.

Each bucket defines an object namespace. S3 server requests specify objects using a bucket-name and object-name pair. An object consists of data, along with optional metadata and access controls, accessible via a name. An object resides within a bucket. There can be more than one bucket in an S3 server. Buckets which are created for the server are associated with an S3 user that is created on the S3 server.\nAn access policy is an object that when associated with a resource, defines their permissions. Buckets and objects are defined as resources. By default, only the \"root\" user can access these resources. Access policies are used to manage access to these resources by enabling ONTAP admin to provide \"grants\" to allow other users to perform operations on the buckets.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving all

The PATCH request provides the option to upgrade the cluster software version. Select the `validate_only` field to validate the package before triggering the update. Set the `version` field to trigger the installation of the package in the cluster. You can pause, resume, or cancel any ongoing software upgrade by selecting `action`. You can use the DELETE request to remove a specific software package present in the cluster.\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving software profile information\nThe following example shows how to retrieve software and firmware profile information.

Set the `version` field to trigger the installation of the package. You can select the `validate_only` field to validate the package before the installation starts. Setting `skip_warning` as `true` ignores the validation warning before the installation starts. Setting the `action` field performs a `pause`, `resume`, or `cancel' operation on an ongoing upgrade. An upgrade can only be resumed if it is in the paused state. Setting `stabilize_minutes` allows each node a specified amount of time to stabilize after a reboot; the default is 8 minutes.\n<br/>You can start the upgrade process at the cluster level. There are no options available to start the upgrade for a specific node or HA pair.\n#### 1. Validating the package and verifying the validation results\nThe following example shows how to validate a cluster software package. You must validate the package before the software upgrade. Set the `validate_only` field to `true` to start the validation. You can check for validation results in the GET /cluster/software endpoint.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/software\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt_ip>/api/cluster/software?validate_only=true\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/hal+json\" -d '{ \"version\": \"9.5.0\"}'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\nThe call to validate the software cluster version returns the job UUID, including a HAL link to retrieve details about the job. The job object includes a `state` field and a message to indicate the progress of the job. When the job is complete and the application is fully created, the message indicates success and the `state` field of the job is set to `success`.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/jobs/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\",\n  \"description\": \"PATCH /api/cluster/software\",\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"success\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\nYou can check for validation results in the GET /cluster/software endpoint.

Pausing, resuming or canceling an upgrade\nThe following example shows how to `pause` an ongoing cluster software package upgrade. Set the `action` field to `pause`, `resume`, or `cancel` to pause, resume or cancel the upgrade respectively. Not all update operations support these actions. An update can only be resumed if it is in the paused state.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/software\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt_ip>/api/cluster/software?action=pause\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/hal+json\" -d '{ \"version\": \"9.5.0\"}'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\nThe call to update the software cluster version and/or firmware version returns the job UUID, including a HAL link to retrieve details about the job. The job object includes a `state` field and a message to indicate the progress of the job. When the job is complete and the application is fully created, the message indicates success and the `state` field of the job is set to `success`.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/jobs/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\",\n  \"description\": \"PATCH /api/cluster/software\",\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"success\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f587d316-5feb-11e8-b0e0-005056956dfc\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\nYou can check the progress of the upgrade in the GET /cluster/software endpoint.

The path field is used to specify the path to the directory or file to be acted on. The path field requires using \"%2E\" to represent \".\" and \"%2F\" to represent \"/\" for the path provided.\n## File data\nRead and write data from/to a named file. To read a file, the Accept request HTTP header must be specified as multipart/form-data, and a value for the `length` query property, which represents the number of bytes to be read, must be specified. The API will fail if the length of data being read/written exceeds 1 MB. This API should only be used on normal files or streams associated with files. The results for other file types, such as LUNs is undefined.<br/>\nThe following APIs are used to read or write data to a file:\n&ndash; GET     /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?byte_offset=0&length=40 -H \"Accept: multipart/form-data\"\n&ndash; POST    /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path} -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" --form \"file=the data to be written to the new file\"\n&ndash; PATCH   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?byte_offset=10 -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" --form \"file=the new data to be written or overwritten to the existing file starting at byte_offset\"\n## Listing directories and files\nA list of files and directories and their properties can be retrieved for a specified path.<br/>\nThe following APIs are used to view a list of files and directories:\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?fields=*\n## File information\nThe metadata and detailed information about a single directory or file can be retrieved by setting the `return_metadata` query property to `true`.

When file system analytics are enabled on a volume, `analytics.*` fields may be requested, and will be populated in the response records corresponding to directories. The API does not support file system analytics for requests that are made beyond the boundary of the specified `volume.uuid`.<br/>\nThe following APIs are used to obtain analytics information for a directory:\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?fields=analytics\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?fields=**\n## QoS\nQoS policies and settings enforce Service Level Objectives (SLO) on a file. A pre-created QoS policy can be used by specifying the `qos.name` or `qos.uuid` properties.</br>\nThe following APIs are used to assign a QoS policy to a file:\n&ndash; PATCH   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path} -d '{ \"qos_policy.name\" : \"policy\" }'\n&ndash; PATCH   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path} -d '{ \"qos_policy.uuid\" : \"b89bc5dd-94a3-11e8-a7a3-0050568edf84\" }'\n## Symlinks\nThe following APIs are used to create a symlink and read the contents of a symlink:\n&ndash; POST   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}  -d '{ \"target\" : \"directory2/file1\" }'\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path}?return_metadata=true&fields=target\n## Rename a file or a directory\nThe following API can be used to rename a file or a directory. Note that you need to provide the path relative to the root of the volume in the `path` body parameter.\n&ndash; PATCH   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/files/{path} -d '{ \"path\" :

An SVM's iSCSI service must be created before iSCSI initiators can log in to the SVM.<br/>\nThe iSCSI service REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover iSCSI services for SVMs.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of the SVM can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These show the performance of the SVM in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properties denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Creating an iSCSI service for an SVM\nThe simplest way to create an iSCSI service is to specify only the SVM, either by name or UUID. By default, the new iSCSI service is enabled and uses the SVM name as its target alias.<br/>\nIn this example, the `return_records` query parameter is used to retrieve the new iSCSI service object in the REST response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/san/iscsi/services\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/san/iscsi/services?return_records=true' -H 'accept:

Parameters are provided in the body of the POST request to configure cluster-wide settings and add nodes during the cluster setup.\n### Fields used for creating a cluster\nThe fields used for the cluster APIs fall into the following categories:\n* Required cluster-wide configuration\n* Optional cluster-wide configuration\n### Required cluster-wide configuration\nThe following fields are always required for any POST /cluster request:\n* name\n* password\n### Optional cluster-wide configuration\nThe following fields are used to set up additional cluster-wide configurations:\n* location\n* contact\n* dns_domains\n* name_servers\n* ntp_servers\n* timezone\n* license\n* configuration_backup\n* management_interface\n* nodes\n### Nodes field\nThe nodes field specifies the nodes to join to the cluster. To use this API, all nodes must run the same version of ONTAP. If you do not specify a node, the cluster is configured with one node added. The REST request is issued to the node that is added to the cluster. If you specify one node, do not use the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\" field. If you specify multiple nodes, specify the node to which the REST request is issued in addition to the remote nodes. Use the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\" field to identify each node. All other node fields are optional in all cases. If you provide a field for one node, you need to provide the same field for all nodes.\n### Node networking fields\nThe cluster management interface and each node management interface use the cluster management interface subnet mask and gateway. For advanced configurations in which the cluster and node management interfaces are on different subnets, use the /network/ip/interface APIs to configure network interfaces after setup is complete.\nThe management interfaces are used to communicate with the name servers and NTP servers. The address family of the name servers and NTP servers must match the management interfaces address family.\n### Single node cluster field\nWhen the \"single_node_cluster\" field is set to \"true\", the cluster is created in single node cluster mode. You can provide a node field for this node for node-specific configuration but do not use the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\" field. Storage failover is configured to non-HA mode, and ports used for cluster ports are moved to the default IPspace. This might cause the node to reboot during setup. While a node reboots, the RESTful interface might not be available. See \"Connection failures during cluster create\" for more information.\n### Create recommended aggregates parameter\nWhen the \"create_recommended_aggregates\" parameter is set to \"true\", aggregates based on an optimal layout recommended by the system are created on each of the nodes in the cluster. The default setting is \"false\".\n<br/>\n---\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of the cluster can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` fields. These fields show the performance of the cluster in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` fields denote an average, whereas the `statistics.*` fields denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n<br/>\n---\n## Monitoring cluster create status\n### Errors before the job starts\nConfiguration in the POST /cluster request is validated before the cluster create job starts. If an invalid configuration is found, an HTTP error code in the 4xx range is returned. No cluster create job is started.\n### Polling on the job\nAfter a successful POST /cluster request is issued, an HTTP error code of 202 is returned along with a job UUID and link in the body of the response. The cluster create job continues asynchronously and is monitored with the job UUID using the /cluster/jobs API. The \"message\" field in the response of the GET /cluster/jobs/{uuid} request shows the current step in the job, and the \"state\" field shows the overall state of the job.\n### Errors during the job\nIf a failure occurs during the cluster create job, the job body provides details of the error along with error code fields. See the error table under \"Responses\" in the POST /cluster documentation for common error codes and descriptions.\n### Rerunning POST /cluster\nThe POST /cluster request can be rerun if errors occur. When rerunning the request, use the same body and query parameters. You can change the value of any field in the original body or query, but you cannot change the provided fields. For example, an initial request might have a body section as follows:\n<br />\n```\nbody =\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"1.1.1.1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"2.2.2.2\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nA rerun request updates the body details to:\n<br />\n```\nbody =\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"3.3.3.3\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"4.4.4.4\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nA rerun request with the following body details is invalid:\n<br />\n```\nbody =\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"3.3.3.3\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote that the password might already be configured. If a password is already configured and then a new password is provided, the new request overwrites the existing password. If a password is already configured either by another interface or by a previous POST request to /cluster, authenticate any future REST requests with that password. If a POST request to /cluster with the default return_timeout of 0 returns an error, then the password was not changed.\n### Connection failures during cluster create\nA request to poll the job status might fail during a cluster create job in the following two cases. In these cases, programmatic use of the RESTful interface might be resilient to these connection failures.\n1. When the \"single_node_cluster\" flag is set to \"true\", the node might reboot. During this time, the RESTful interface might refuse connections and return errors on a GET request, or connection timeouts might occur. Programmatic use of the RESTful interface during reboots must consider these effects while polling a cluster create job.\n2. The \"mgmt_auto\" LIF is removed during the cluster create job. A POST /cluster request might be issued on the \"mgmt_auto\" LIF. However, requests to poll the job status might fail during cluster create when the \"mgmt_auto\" LIF is removed. The \"mgmt_auto\" LIF is only removed if a cluster management interface is provided as an argument to POST /cluster, and only after the cluster management interface is created. Programmatic use of the POST /cluster API on the \"mgmt_auto\" LIF should be configured to dynamically switch to polling the job on the cluster management LIF.\n<br/>\n---\n## Modifying cluster configurations\nThe following fields can be used to modify a cluster-wide configuration:\n* name\n* location\n* contact\n* dns_domains\n* name_servers\n* timezone\n* certificate\n<br/>\n---\n# Examples\n### Minimally configuring a 2-node setup\n<br/>\n```\n# Body\nminimal_2_node_cluster.txt(body):\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateExample1\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"1.1.1.1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"2.2.2.2\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster\" -d \"@minimal_2_node_cluster.txt\"\n```\n---\n### Setting up a single node with additional node configuration and auto aggregate creation\n<br/>\n```\n# Body\nsingle_node_additional_config.txt(body):\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateExample2\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"singleNode\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunnyvale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster?single_node_cluster=true&create_recommended_aggregates=true\" -d \"@single_node_additional_config.txt\"\n```\n---\n### Modifying a cluster-wide configuration\n<br/>\n```\n# Body\nmodify_cluster_config.txt(body):\n{\n  \"contact\": \"it@company.com\"\n}\n# Request\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster\" -d \"@modify_cluster_config.txt\"\n```\n---\n## Creating a cluster using the cluster \"create\" operation\nThis example shows how to create a cluster using the cluster APIs. Specifically, this example shows the creation of a two-node cluster and uses information from the nodes themselves combined with user supplied information to configure the cluster.\n### Preparing for setup\nBefore the REST APIs can be issued to create the cluster, the cluster must be wired up and powered on. The network connections between the nodes for the cluster interconnect and the connections to the management network must be completed.  After the nodes are powered on, the nodes automatically configure interfaces on the platform's default cluster ports to allow the nodes to discover each other during setup and expansion workflows. You must configure a management interface on one node or use the mgmt_auto LIF, which is assigned an IP address using DHCP, to start using the REST APIs.  By making a console connection to a node, the cluster setup wizard guides you through the configuration of the initial node managment interface to which the REST calls can be sent.  Once this step is completed, exit the wizard by typing \"exit\". You can then issue REST API requests.\n1.  Wire and power on the nodes.\n2.  Make a console connection to one node to access the cluster setup wizard.\n3.  Enter node management interface information to enable REST API requests to be sent to the node.\n```\nWelcome to the cluster setup wizard.\nYou can enter the following commands at any time:\n  \"help\" or \"?\" - if you want to have a question clarified,\n  \"back\" - if you want to change previously answered questions, and\n  \"exit\" or \"quit\" - if you want to quit the cluster setup wizard.\n  Any changes you made before quitting will be saved.\n  You can return to cluster setup at any time by typing \"cluster setup\".\n  To accept a default or omit a question, do not enter a value.\n  This system will send event messages and periodic reports to NetApp Technical\n  Support. To disable this feature, enter\n  autosupport modify -support disable\n  within 24 hours.\n  Enabling AutoSupport can significantly speed problem determination and\n  resolution should a problem occur on your system.\n  For further information on AutoSupport, see:\n    http://support.netapp.com/autosupport/\n    Type yes to confirm and continue {yes}: yes\n    Enter the node management interface port [e0c]:\n      Enter the node management interface IP address: 10.224.82.249\n      Enter the node management interface netmask: 255.255.192.0\n      Enter the node management interface default gateway: 10.224.64.1\n      A node management interface on port e0c with IP address 10.224.82.249 has been created.\n      Use your web browser to complete cluster setup by accessing\n      https://10.224.82.249\n      Otherwise, press Enter to complete cluster setup using the command line\n      interface: exit\n      Exiting the cluster setup wizard. Any changes you made have been saved.\n      The cluster administrator's account (username \"admin\") password is set to the system default.\n      Warning: You have exited the cluster setup wizard before completing all\n      of the tasks. The cluster is not configured. You can complete cluster setup by typing\n      \"cluster setup\" in the command line interface.\n```\n---\n### Discovering the nodes\nIf you issue a GET /api/cluster/nodes request when the nodes are not in a cluster, the API returns a list of nodes that were discovered on the cluster interconnect.  Information returned includes the node's serial number, model, software version, UUID, and cluster interface address.  The number of nodes returned should be the same as the number of nodes expected to be in the cluster.  If too many nodes are discovered, remove the nodes that should not be part of the cluster.  If not enough nodes are discovered, verify all the nodes are powered on, that the connections to the cluster interconnect are complete, and retry the command.\n<br />\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/nodes\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/nodes?fields=state,uptime\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"6dce4710-c860-11e9-b5bc-005056bb6135\",\n      \"name\": \"cluster1\",\n      \"uptime\": 134555,\n      \"state\": \"up\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes/6dce4710-c860-11e9-b5bc-005056bb6135\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/nodes?fields=state,uptime\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Creating the cluster\nWhen the node information is available, including each node's cluster interface address, you can assemble the information for creating the cluster.  Provide the cluster name and the password for the admin account.  The rest of the information is optional and can be configured later using other APIs.  Provide the cluster interface address for each node to be included in the cluster so that you can connect to it while adding it to the cluster. In addition to the cluster interface address, you can provide the optional node name, location, and management interface information. If you do not provide node names, nodes are named based on the cluster name. The nodes' managment interface subnet mask and gateway values are omitted and must be the same as the cluster management interface's subnet mask and gateway.\n<br />\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d '{\"name\":\"cluster1\",\"location\":\"datacenter1\",\"contact\":\"me\",\"dns_domains\":[\"example.com\"],\"name_servers\":[\"10.224.223.130\",\"10.224.223.131\",\"10.224.223.132\"],\"ntp_servers\":[\"time.nist.gov\"],\"management_interface\":{\"ip\":{\"address\":\"10.224.82.25\",\"netmask\":\"255.255.192.0\",\"gateway\":\"10.224.64.1\"}},\"password\":\"mypassword\",\"license\":{\"keys\":[\"AMEPOSOIKLKGEEEEDGNDEKSJDE\"]},\"nodes\":[{\"cluster_interface\":{\"ip\":{\"address\":\"169.254.245.113\"}},\"name\":\"node1\",\"management_interface\":{\"ip\":{\"address\":\"10.224.82.29\"}}},{\"cluster_interface\":{\"ip\":{\"address\":\"169.254.217.95\"}},\"name\":\"node2\",\"management_interface\":{\"ip\":{\"address\":\"10.224.82.31\"}}}]}'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Monitoring the progress of cluster creation\nTo monitor the progress of the cluster create operation, poll the returned job link until the state value is no longer \"runnning\" or \"queued\".\n<br />\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-1e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\" -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\",\n  \"description\": \"POST /api/cluster\",\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"success\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Verifying the cluster information\nAfter the cluster is created, you can verify the information applied using a number of APIs.

To grant access to a LUN from one or more hosts, create an initiator group containing the host initiator names, then create a LUN map that associates the initiator group with the LUN.<br/>\nThe initator group REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover initiator groups, and add and remove initiators that can access the target and associated LUNs.\nAn initiator can appear in multiple initiator groups. An initiator group can be mapped to multiple LUNs. A specific initiator can be mapped to a specific LUN only once.<br/>\nAll initiators in an initiator group must be from the same operating system. The initiator group's operating system is specified when the initiator group is created.<br/>\nWhen an initiator group is created, the `protocol` property is used to restrict member initiators to Fibre Channel (_fcp_), iSCSI (_iscsi_), or both (_mixed_).<br/>\nZero or more initiators can be supplied when the initiator group is created. After creation, initiators can be added or removed from the initiator group using the `/protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators` endpoint. See [`POST /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_create) and [`DELETE /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators/{name}`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_delete) for more details.<br/>\nAn FC WWPN consist of 16 hexadecimal digits grouped as 8 pairs separated by colons.

The iSCSI EUI format consists of the _eui._ prefix followed by 16 hexadecimal characters.\n## Examples\n### Creating an initiator group with no initiators\nThe example initiator group is for Linux iSCSI initiators only.

For example, it can be used to run scans only in off-peak hours, or to scan very large files that are excluded from an on-access scan. Vscan On-Demand scanning can be used for any path in the SVM namespace.<p/>\nVscan On-Demand policy configurations define the scope of a Vscan On-Demand scan. The schedule parameter in the On-Demand policy configuration decides when to execute the task. Schedule can be created using the /api/clusters/schedule endpoint and can be assigned on policy create or policy modify. This API is used to retrieve and manage Vscan On-Demand policy configurations.

The \"message\" field in the response of the GET /cluster/jobs/{uuid} request shows the current step in the job, and the \"state\" field shows the overall state of the job.\n<br/>\n---\n## Examples\n### Running the diagnostics operation\nThis example shows the POST request for starting a diagnostic operation for a MetroCluster over IP configuration and the responses returned:\n```\n#API\n/api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\n```\n### POST Request\n```\ncurl -X POST https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\n```\n### POST Response\n```\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nDate: Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:20:53 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nLocation: /api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\nContent-Length: 189\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Monitoring the job progress\nUse the link provided in the response to the POST request to fetch information for the diagnostics operation job.\n<br/>\n#### Request\n```\ncurl -X GET https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\n```\n<br/>\n#### Job status response\n```\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nDate: Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:21:12 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 345\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\",\n  \"description\": \"POST /api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\",\n  \"state\": \"running\",\n  \"message\": \"Checking nodes...\",\n  \"code\": 2432853,\n  \"start_time\": \"2020-09-22T13:20:53-04:00\",\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Final status of the diagnostics job\n```\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nDate: Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:29:04 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 372\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\",\n  \"description\": \"POST /api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\",\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"success\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"start_time\": \"2020-09-22T13:20:53-04:00\",\n  \"end_time\": \"2020-09-22T13:22:04-04:00\",\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/f7d3804c-fcf7-11ea-acaf-005056bb47c1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Retrieving the diagnostics operation\n#### Request\n```\ncurl -X GET https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\n```\n#### Response\n```\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nDate: Tue, 22 Sep 2020 18:04:28 GMT\nServer: libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 1005\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\n{\n  \"node\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"interface\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggregate\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"cluster\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"connection\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"volume\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"config_replication\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-09-22T13:47:01-04:00\",\n    \"state\": \"ok\",\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"message\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/metrocluster/diagnostics\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Related ONTAP Commands\n* `metrocluster check run`\n* `metrocluster check show`\n","tags":["cluster"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"in":"query","name":"schedule","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"integer","description":"Shows the minutes of every hour when a job runs.

It also provides a platform for policy management functions, such as policy enabling and disabling. As part of FPolicy policy configuration, you can specifiy the name of policy, the SVM to which it belongs, the FPolicy events to monitor, the FPolicy engine to which the generated notifications are sent and the policy priority. FPolicy policy configuration also allows to you to configure the file access behaviour when the primary and secondary servers are down. Under such circumstances, if the \"mandatory\" field is set to true, file access is denied.</br>\nEach FPolicy policy is associated with a scope which allows you to restrain the scope of the policy to specified storage objects such as volume, shares and export or to a set of file extensions such as .txt, .jpeg. An FPolicy policy can be configured to send notifications, to the FPolicy server or for native file blocking which uses the file extension specified in the policy scope. An SVM can have multiple FPolicy policies which can be enabled or disabled independently of each other.\n## Examples\n### Creating an FPolicy policy\nUse the following API to create an FPolicy policy configuration.

To create an asynchronous extended data protection relationship with FlexVol volumes, FlexGroup volumes, or SVMs, use the policy of type \"async\". To create a synchronous relationship between FlexVol volumes, use the policy of type \"sync\" with sync_type of either \"sync\" or \"strict_sync\". To create an active synchronous relationship with automated failover between Consistency Group endpoints, use the policy of type \"sync\" with sync_type \"automated_failover\". You can create an asynchronous extended data protection relationship between the source and destination which can be used by the transfer APIs to perform SnapMirror \"restore\" operations.<br/>\nTo create FlexVol or FlexGroup SnapMirror relationships, the source volume must be in the \"online\" state and be a read-write type; the destination volume must be in the \"online\" state and be a data protection type.\nTo create SnapMirror relationships between SVMs, the source SVM must be of subtype \"default\" and the destination SVM of subtype \"dp_destination\". Additionally, SVMs must be peered before a relationship can be established between them when the \"create_destination\" property is not specified.

There are several properties that can be modified on an aggregate. Only one property can be modified for each PATCH request.\nPATCH operations on the aggregate's disk count will be blocked while one or more nodes in the cluster are simulating or implementing automatic aggregate creation.</br>\nThe following is a list of properties that can be modified using the PATCH operation including a brief description for each:\n* name - This property can be changed to rename the aggregate.\n* node.name and node.uuid - Either property can be updated in order to relocate the aggregate to a different node in the cluster.\n* block_storage.mirror.enabled - This property can be changed from 'false' to 'true' in order to mirror the aggregate, if the system is capable of doing so.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_count - This property can be updated to increase the number of disks in an aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_size - This property can be updated to set the desired RAID size.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_type - This property can be updated to set the desired RAID type.\n* cloud_storage.tiering_fullness_threshold - This property can be updated to set the desired tiering fullness threshold if using FabricPool.\n* data_encryption.software_encryption_enabled - This property enables or disables NAE on the aggregate.\n### Aggregate expansion\nThe PATCH operation also supports automatically expanding an aggregate based on the spare disks which are present within the system. Running PATCH with the query \"auto_provision_policy\" set to \"expand\" starts the recommended expansion job. In order to see the expected change in capacity before starting the job, call GET on an aggregate instance with the query \"auto_provision_policy\" set to \"expand\".\n### Manual simulated aggregate expansion\nThe PATCH operation also supports simulated manual expansion of an aggregate.\nRunning PATCH with the query \"simulate\" set to \"true\" and \"block_storage.primary.disk_count\" set to the final disk count will start running the prechecks associated with expanding the aggregate to the proposed size.\nThe response body will include information on how many disks the aggregate can be expanded to, any associated warnings, along with the proposed final size of the aggregate.\n## Deleting storage aggregates\nIf volumes exist on an aggregate, they must be deleted or moved before the aggregate can be deleted.\nSee the /storage/volumes API for details on moving or deleting volumes.\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a specific aggregate from the cluster\nThe following example shows the response of the requested aggregate.

It is a best practice to configure ONTAP with four independent external time servers.</br>\nTo aid set up, the Pre-Cluster API of POST /cluster supports a list of NTP time servers\nusing either the host name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.</br>\nYou can enhance time security by acquiring private keys from external time servers, recording those keys and\nconfiguring the entries that match the external time servers to use those keys.</br>\nTo use NTP symmetric authentication keys (keys), the shared private key must be recorded\nfirst using the /cluster/ntp/keys API associated with the server and enabled to be used.\n## APIs\nThere are three sets of APIs. The most basic set is part of the /api/cluster APIs, in which a set of NTP servers are provided.\nThe next two sets are used to manage the NTP servers in more detail and optionally record keys to enable NTP\nsymmetric authentication.\n### [`/api/cluster`](#docs-cluster-cluster)\nMore details can be found under the documentation for [`/api/cluster`](#docs-cluster-cluster).

Share-level ACLs can be configured by using either Windows users and groups or UNIX users and groups. A share-level ACL consists of a list of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains a user or group name and a set of permissions that determines user or group access to the share, regardless of the security style of the volume or qtree containing the share. </br>\nWhen an SMB user tries to access a share, ONTAP checks the share-level ACL to determine whether access should be granted. A share-level ACL only restricts access to files in the share; it never grants more access than the file level ACLs.\n## Examples\n### Creating a CIFS share ACL\nTo create a share ACL for a CIFS share, use the following API.

Most application interfaces abstract away the underlying ONTAP storage elements, but this interface exposes what is necessary to connect to and uses the storage that is provisioned for an application. See the application component model for a detailed description of each property.\n### Access\nEach application component can be accessed via NFS, CIFS, or SAN. NFS and CIFS access can be enabled simultaneously. Each access section includes a `backing_storage` property. This property is used to correlate the storage elements with the access elements of the application. The `backing_storage` portion of the access section provides the `type` and `uuid` of the backing storage. There is another `backing_storage` property at the same level as the access properties which contains lists of backing storage elements corresponding to the types listed in the access section.\n### Learn more\n* [`DOC /application`](#docs-application-overview)\n","tags":["application"]}},"/protocols/fpolicy":{"x-ntap-long-description":{"description":"## Overview\nFPolicy is an infrastructure component of ONTAP that enables partner applications to connect to ONTAP in order to monitor and set file access permissions. Every time a client accesses a file from a storage system, based on the configuration of FPolicy, the partner application is notified about file access. This enables partners to set restrictions on files that are created or accessed on the storage system. FPolicy also allows you to create file policies that specify file operation permissions according to file type. For example, you can restrict certain file types, such as .jpeg and .mp3 files, from being stored on the storage system. FPolicy can monitor file access from CIFS and NFS clients.</br>\nAs part of FPolicy configuration, you can specify an FPolicy engine which defines the external FPolicy server, FPolicy events, which defines the protocol and file operations to monitor and the FPolicy policy that acts as a container for the FPolicy engine and FPolicy events. It provides a way for policy management functions, such as policy enabling and disabling.\n## Examples\n### Creating an FPolicy configuration\nTo create an FPolicy for an SVM use the following API.

Optionally, it can be located within a qtree in a volume.<br/>\nA LUN can be created to a specified size using thin or thick provisioning. A LUN can then be renamed, resized, cloned, and moved to a different volume. LUNs support the assignment of a quality of service (QoS) policy for performance management or a QoS policy can be assigned to the volume containing the LUN. See the LUN object model to learn more about each of the properties supported by the LUN REST API.<br/>\nA LUN must be mapped to an initiator group to grant access to the initiator group's initiators (client hosts). Initiators can then access the LUN and perform I/O over a Fibre Channel (FC) fabric using the FC Protocol or a TCP/IP network using iSCSI.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of a LUN can be monitored by observing the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` properties. These properties show the performance of a LUN in terms of IOPS, latency and throughput. The `metric.*` properties denote an average whereas `statistics.*` properies denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across all nodes.\n## Examples\n### Creating a LUN\nThis example creates a 300 gigabyte, thin-provisioned LUN in SVM _svm1_, volume _vol1_, configured for use by _linux_ initiators.

As blocks of the source and clone are modified, unique blocks are written for each. LUN clones can be created quickly and consume very little space initially. They can be created for the purpose of back-up, or to replicate data for multiple consumers.<br/>\nSpace reservations can be set for the LUN clone independent of the source LUN by setting the `space.guarantee.requested` property in a POST or PATCH request.<br/>\nA LUN clone can also be set to auto-delete by setting the `auto_delete` property. If the LUN's volume is configured for automatic deletion, LUNs that have auto-delete enabled are deleted when a volume is nearly full to reclaim a target amount of free space in the volume.\n## Examples\n### Creating a new LUN clone\nYou create a new LUN clone as you create any LUN - a POST request to [`/storage/luns`](#/SAN/lun_create). Set `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` to identify the source LUN from which the clone is created. The LUN clone and its source must reside in the same volume.\n<br/>\nThe source LUN can reside in a Snapshot copy, in which case the `clone.source.name` field must be used to identify it. Add `/.snapshot/<snapshot_name>` to the path after the volume name to identify the Snapshot copy. For example `/vol/vol1/.snapshot/snap1/lun1`.\n<br/>\nBy default, new LUN clones do not inherit the QoS policy of the source LUN; a QoS policy should be set for the clone by setting the `qos_policy` property.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/luns\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" }, \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun2clone1\", \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun2\" } }, \"qos_policy\": { \"name\": \"qos1\" } }'\n```\n### Over-writing an existing LUN's data as a clone of another\nYou can overwrite an existing LUN as a clone of another, using a PATCH request to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#/SAN/lun_modify). Set the `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` property to identify the source LUN from which the clone data is taken. The LUN clone and its source must reside in the same volume.<br/>\nWhen used in a PATCH request, the patched LUN's data is overwritten as a clone of the source. The following properties are preserved from the patched LUN unless otherwise specified as part of the PATCH: `class`, `auto_delete`, `lun_maps`, `serial_number`, `status.state`, and `uuid`.<br/>\nPersistent reservations for the updated LUN are also preserved.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns/5a24ae5b-28af-47fb-b129-5adf6cfba0a6' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun2\" } } }'\n```\n---\n## Moving LUNs between volumes\nYou move a LUN between volumes by using a PATCH request to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#/SAN/lun_modify). Set the volume portion of the fully qualified LUN path `name` property, `path.volume.uuid`, or `path.volume.name` property to a different volume than the LUN's current volume. Moving a LUN between volumes is an asynchronous activity. A successful request returns a response of 200 synchronously, which indicates that the movement has been successfully queued. The LUN object can then be further polled with a GET request to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#lun_get) to monitor the status of the movement.<br/>\nThe `movement` sub-object of the LUN object is populated while a LUN movement is in progress and for two minutes following completion of a movement.\n## Examples\n### Starting a LUN movement\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns/7faf0a9e-0a47-4876-8318-3638d5da16bf' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun3\" }'\n```\n### Checking on the status of the LUN movement\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns/7faf0a9e-0a47-4876-8318-3638d5da16bf?fields=movement' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"7faf0a9e-0a47-4876-8318-3638d5da16bf\",\n  \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun3\",\n  \"movement\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"destination\": \"/vol/vol1/lun3\",\n      \"source\": \"/vol/vol2/lun3\"\n    },\n    \"progress\": {\n      \"elapsed\": 1,\n      \"percent_complete\": 0,\n      \"state\": \"preparing\",\n      \"volume_snapshot_blocked\": false\n    }\n  },\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/storage/luns/7faf0a9e-0a47-4876-8318-3638d5da16bf\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Deleting a LUN\n```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns/c903a978-9bac-4ce9-8237-4a3ba8b13f08' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n```\n---\n","tags":["SAN"]},"post":{"parameters":[{"required":"1","in":"body","name":"info","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/lun"},"description":"The property values for the new LUN.\n"},{"in":"query","name":"return_records","x-ntap-introduced":"DO_NOT_DISPLAY","type":"boolean","default":"","description":"The default is false.
